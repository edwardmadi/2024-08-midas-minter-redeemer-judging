# Ineffective Event Emission for Approved Request Redemptions and Deposits

### Summary

The protocol fails to emit detailed events for approved request redemptions and deposits. 


### Root Cause

In [`DepositVault.approveRequest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L231-L238) and [`RedemptionVault.approveRequest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVault.sol#L223-L230), the current implementation **does not emit events detailing the amounts of tokens being redeemed or deposited**. 

The `approveRequest()` event only emits `ApproveRequest(requestId, _newTokenRate_)`, but it lacks information on the actual tokens involved (payment token for redemption, mToken for deposit) and the calculated amounts based on the admin-specified rate.

According to the [`Admin can fulfill a standard mint request documentation`](https://ludicrous-rate-748.notion.site/8060186191934380800b669406f4d83c?v=35634cda6b084e2191b83f295433efdf&p=b2d81e54f6bc482ea9fbc889bbfec9ff&pm=s) and [`Admin can fulfill a standard redemption request documentation`](https://ludicrous-rate-748.notion.site/8060186191934380800b669406f4d83c?v=35634cda6b084e2191b83f295433efdf&p=1ad02733634b432f97094ac3748efd37&pm=s):
> The admin actions will eventually be reported to the user in a transaction history dashboard (we may need to emit an event)

Event emission plays a crucial role, so it is important to emit all relevant fields, including the amounts of tokens involved in the transaction.


### Impact

Users are unable to see the specific amounts of tokens involved in their fullfilled request operation.


### Mitigation

Update the event emission logic to include detailed information on the token output amounts after fulfilling the request.
