# Additional Functionality Available in Special Redeem Contracts Due to Inheritence

### Summary

There are several contracts described in docs that have special functionalities:
- [MBasisRedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol#L19)
- [MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/mBasis/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol#L17)
- [RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/mBasis/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol)

Because of inheritance chain aforementioned contracts have functionalities other than expected, which allows users to perform request type of redeems, which is not expected for these contracts and could led to unexpected accounting problems and funds loss by users.

### Root Cause

According to the documentation, there are several "special purpose contracts" like:
- [MBasisRedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol#L19)
- [MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/mBasis/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol#L17)
- [RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/mBasis/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol)

These contracts should allow performance of instant redeems with additional logic [as specified in docs](https://ludicrous-rate-748.notion.site/Special-Contract-Version-User-can-instantly-redeem-mTBILL-for-USDC-pulled-from-BUIDL-927832e82a874221996c1edcc1d94b17):
**BUIDL**
_The smartcontract atomically redeems BUIDL tokens for USDC if there is not enough USDC in the smartcontract. The BUIDL tokens are also held in the smartcontract._ 

**Swapper**
_The user redeems mBASIS instantly for USDC via both already available USDC and an mTBILL instant USDC redemption (facilitated via a mBASIS-mTBILL liquidity provider)._

However, it should be observed that these _special contracts_ inherits from `RedeemVault`, and functions that are not **overwritten** are still available in these special contracts. Users are able to call following functions due to UI or documentation/integration problems:

- redeemFiatRequest
- redeemRequest

These functions are for 2-step redeem flow, which should be not available in these "special" contracts. As a result, users can lock funds, which recovery would need special action from admins.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

Attack described in previous points.

### Impact

Users tokens will be locked in aforementioned special contracts. To recover them, admins will have to preserve special actions to refund users.

### PoC

-

### Mitigation

It is recommended to overwrite, not used functions so these are not available for users.
