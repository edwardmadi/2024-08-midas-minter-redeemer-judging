# `_validateMinAmount()` Function in `DepositVault` contract Missing Implementing the validation of inputted USD amount >= minAmountToDepositInUsd

## Summary
The `DepositVault` contract's `_validateMinAmount()` function is designed to ensure that a user's deposit meets a minimum threshold, particularly for the first deposit. According to the code comment, this function should validate that the inputted USD amount is greater than or equal to `minAmountToDepositInUsd()`. However, the current implementation of the contract does not include this validation, which could lead to the acceptance of deposits that do not meet the required minimum amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
- **Missing Validation**: The `_validateMinAmount()` function is expected to check that the deposit amount in USD is at least equal to a predefined minimum amount (`minAmountToDepositInUsd()`). This is crucial for ensuring that deposits meet the minimum requirements set by the contract.
- **Impact**: Without this validation, the contract may accept deposits below the required threshold, potentially undermining the contract's intended functionality and financial security. This could lead to issues such as:
  - **Inconsistent Deposits**: Users may deposit amounts that do not meet the expected minimum, disrupting the contract's operational logic.
  - **Financial Risk**: Accepting lower amounts than intended could impact the financial stability and security of the contract.
 
## Impact
- **Financial Integrity**: Ensuring that all deposits meet the minimum threshold is crucial for maintaining the financial integrity of the contract. Without proper validation, the contract may operate with inconsistencies that could affect its overall functionality.
- **Contract Reliability**: The absence of this validation might lead to unexpected behaviors or errors during deposit processing, potentially impacting the reliability of the contract.

## Recommendation
Ensure that the `_validateMinAmount()` function is implemented to check that the deposit amount in USD is greater than or equal to the minimum required amount.
