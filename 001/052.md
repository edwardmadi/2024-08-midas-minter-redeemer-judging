# Logical Flaw in the Calculation of :: amountMTokenWithoutFee within :: _calcAndValidateDeposit Function allowing user to mint more tokens

## Summary
A critical flaw has been discovered in the `_calcAndValidateDeposit` function, which is integral to the smart contract's handling of token deposits. The issue pertains to the improper calculation of the `amountMTokenWithoutFee` variable, a value that represents the net `mToken`amount after deducting applicable fees. The current implementation fails to adequately subtract the fee's mToken equivalent from the total mToken amount, resulting in an erroneous `amountMTokenWithoutFee` value. This oversight has profound implications for the contract's financial operations, potentially leading to users being over-credited in their mToken balances.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [_calcAndValidateDeposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L282) function is a core component of the contract, responsible for processing user deposits. It performs a series of critical calculations:

-  [Conversion of Token to USD](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L407): The function converts the deposited token amount (amountToken) into its USD equivalent (`tokenAmountInUsd`), considering the token's current exchange rate (tokenInRate).

- [Fee Calculation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L385): It computes the applicable fee (`feeTokenAmount`) based on the transaction parameters, which include the sender's address, the token involved, and whether the transaction is an instant operation. The fee is subtracted from the total token amount to yield amountTokenWithoutFee.

- [Conversion of USD to mToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L429): The function then converts the net USD amount (after fee deduction) into the equivalent mToken amount (`mintAmount`), using a conversion rate (`tokenOutRate`).

Validation of Minimum Deposit Amount: The function checks if the resulting `mintAmount` meets the minimum mToken deposit requirements. If the user's total mToken balance is zero, an additional check ensures that the first deposit meets a higher minimum threshold.

Final Assignments: The function then assigns the calculated values to the respective variables, readying them for further use in the transaction process.

This oversight leads to a situation where `amountMTokenWithoutFee` does not accurately represent the `mToken` amount post-fee deduction. 

Steps to produce:
*Initial Deposit:* A user initiates a deposit of 100 tokens, with a fee rate of 2%. The [_calcAndValidateDeposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L387) function converts the tokens to USD, applies the fee, and then calculates the mToken equivalent.

*Examine Calculations:* Observe that [amountTokenWithoutFee is correctly calculated as amountToken - feeTokenAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L383). However, `amountMTokenWithoutFee` is incorrectly assigned without subtracting the mToken equivalent of the fee.

*Final Output:* The function outputs an inflated `amountMTokenWithoutFee`, which does not reflect the proper deduction of fees in `mToken` terms.

The calculation of `amountMTokenWithoutFee` should closely follow the pattern used for `amountTokenWithoutFee`. Specifically, after converting the fee amount to its mToken equivalent, this value should be subtracted from the total `mToken` amount to yield an accurate `amountMTokenWithoutFee.`

Since fees will not be deducted users will mint more tokens than intended as fee will not be removed from it value. 

Two functions calls this internally and the logical bugs affect them every time it would be called uponupon as you can see below:
[DeposiitRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L178) and [DepositInstant](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L104), however the depositrequest does call _calcAndValidateDeposit but doesn't mint directly to users but just to make a request for a deposit but An admin can call _approveRequest to approve this and mint unintended amount to the user. 

## Impact
Users may receive more mTokens than they should.

            "DV: minReceiveAmount > actual"
        );

        totalMinted[user] += mintAmount;

        _requireAndUpdateLimit(mintAmount);

        _tokenTransferFromUser(
            tokenInCopy,
            tokensReceiver,

        );
    }
```

```solidity
function _calcAndValidateDeposit(
        address user,
        address tokenIn,
        uint256 amountToken,
        bool isInstant
    )
        internal
        returns (
            uint256 tokenAmountInUsd,
            uint256 feeTokenAmount,
            uint256 amountTokenWithoutFee,

        tokenDecimals = _tokenDecimals(tokenIn);

        _requireTokenExists(tokenIn);

        (uint256 amountInUsd, uint256 tokenInUSDRate) = _convertTokenToUsd(
            tokenIn,
            amountToken
        );
        tokenAmountInUsd = amountInUsd;
        tokenInRate = tokenInUSDRate;
        address userCopy = user;

        _requireAndUpdateAllowance(tokenIn, amountToken);

        feeTokenAmount = _truncate(
            _getFeeAmount(userCopy, tokenIn, amountToken, isInstant, 0),
            tokenDecimals
        );
        amountTokenWithoutFee = amountToken - feeTokenAmount;

        uint256 feeInUsd = (feeTokenAmount * tokenInRate) / 10**18;

        (uint256 mTokenAmount, uint256 mTokenRate) = _convertUsdToMToken(
            tokenAmountInUsd - feeInUsd
        );
        mintAmount = mTokenAmount;    <--------------- 
        tokenOutRate = mTokenRate;

        if (!isFreeFromMinAmount[userCopy]) {
            _validateMinAmount(userCopy, mintAmount);         <------------------  Uses minAmount instead of amountTokenWithoutFee
        }
        require(mintAmount > 0, "DV: invalid mint amount");
    }
```

```solidity
function _validateMinAmount(address user, uint256 amountMTokenWithoutFee)     <-----------
        internal
        view
    {
        require(amountMTokenWithoutFee >= minAmount, "DV: mToken amount < min");    <---------------- No fee taken from minAmount

        if (totalMinted[user] != 0) return;

        require(
            amountMTokenWithoutFee >= minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit,
            "DV: mint amount < min"
        );
    }
```
However since there was no fee deduction user gets to mint tokens more than intended as you can see here at  line [130](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L130). 

```solidity
mToken.mint(user, mintAmount);
```
Where the MintAmount should have been deducted but it wasn't.


## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Amend the `_calcAndValidateDeposit` function to properly deduct the fee from the USD equivalent before calculating mintAmount. This ensures that the mTokens minted accurately reflect the amount after fee deduction.

> Solution:

Convert the total USD value (tokenAmountInUsd) into mTokens:
```solidity
(uint256 totalMTokenAmount, uint256 mTokenRate) = _convertUsdToMToken(tokenAmountInUsd);
```

Convert the fee USD value (feeInUsd) into mTokens:
```solidity
(uint256 feeMTokenAmount, ) = _convertUsdToMToken(feeInUsd);
```

Now, subtract the mToken equivalent of the fee from the total mToken amount:
```solidity
uint256 amountMTokenWithoutFee = totalMTokenAmount - feeMTokenAmount
```
