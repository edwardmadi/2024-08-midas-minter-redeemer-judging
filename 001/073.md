# Fees were not accounted when performing the minimum investment check

## Summary
Fees were not accounted when performing the minimum investment check
## Vulnerability Detail
According Midas doc, it should be true that a eligible user must deposit at least 120,000 USD equivalent assets for their first depositing:
>When you purchase mBASIS from Midas for the first time, a minimum investment of 120,000 USDC is required. There are no minimums for the following transactions.

When either `DepositVault#depositInstant‎()` or `DepositVault#depositRequest‎()` is called, the contract checks if the minimum investment requirement is met if it is the first deposit:
```solidity
    function _validateMinAmount(address user, uint256 amountMTokenWithoutFee)
        internal
        view
    {
        require(amountMTokenWithoutFee >= minAmount, "DV: mToken amount < min");

        if (totalMinted[user] != 0) return;

@>      require(
@>          amountMTokenWithoutFee >= minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit,
@>          "DV: mint amount < min"
@>      );
    }
```
`amountMTokenWithoutFee` is calculated in `_calcAndValidateDeposit‎()`:
```solidity
    function _calcAndValidateDeposit(
        address user,
        address tokenIn,
        uint256 amountToken,
        bool isInstant
    )
        internal
        returns (
            uint256 tokenAmountInUsd,
            uint256 feeTokenAmount,
            uint256 amountTokenWithoutFee,
            uint256 mintAmount,
            uint256 tokenInRate,
            uint256 tokenOutRate,
            uint256 tokenDecimals
        )
    {
        require(amountToken > 0, "DV: invalid amount");

        tokenDecimals = _tokenDecimals(tokenIn);

        _requireTokenExists(tokenIn);

        (uint256 amountInUsd, uint256 tokenInUSDRate) = _convertTokenToUsd(
            tokenIn,
            amountToken
        );
        tokenAmountInUsd = amountInUsd;
        tokenInRate = tokenInUSDRate;
        address userCopy = user;

        _requireAndUpdateAllowance(tokenIn, amountToken);

        feeTokenAmount = _truncate(
            _getFeeAmount(userCopy, tokenIn, amountToken, isInstant, 0),
            tokenDecimals
        );
        amountTokenWithoutFee = amountToken - feeTokenAmount;

        uint256 feeInUsd = (feeTokenAmount * tokenInRate) / 10**18;

@>      (uint256 mTokenAmount, uint256 mTokenRate) = _convertUsdToMToken(
            tokenAmountInUsd - feeInUsd
        );
@>      mintAmount = mTokenAmount;
        tokenOutRate = mTokenRate;

        if (!isFreeFromMinAmount[userCopy]) {
            _validateMinAmount(userCopy, mintAmount);
        }
        require(mintAmount > 0, "DV: invalid mint amount");
    }
```
As we can see, `amountMTokenWithoutFee` does not account for fees. No one can successfully call either `DepositVault#depositInstant()` or `DepositVault#depositRequest()` by depositing only $120,000 USD equivalent assets for their first deposit, as long as the fee is not `0`.

## Impact
The minimum investment requirement does not work as described in the Midas specification. Users have to pay more than the minimum investment to finish their first depositing.
