# Misalignment in Minimum Deposit Validation Compromises First-Time User Onboarding

## Summary
The DepositVault contract's implementation of the minimum deposit check for first-time users deviates from the intended design, potentially leading to erroneous validations and disrupting the user onboarding process.
## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation in DepositVault fails to accurately enforce the minimum deposit requirement for new users due to a discrepancy between the code and the documented specifications:

1. Documentation specifies a $120,000 USD minimum for initial deposits.
2. The `minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit` variable is ambiguously defined thoughout contracts and its setter function, lacking clear units.
3. The `_validateMinAmount` function directly compares mToken amounts without USD conversion.

leading to:
1. Precision Mismatch: If `minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit` is set in USD terms (e.g. 120,000 * 10^18), but compared directly to mToken amounts, it could result in an extremely high minimum deposit requirement, effectively blocking most users from participating.
    
2. Dynamic Threshold: The mToken price relative to USD may fluctuate, causing the effective minimum deposit to change frequently. This could lead to a situation where deposits are accepted during low-price periods and rejected during high-price periods, creating an unpredictable and potentially unfair entry barrier.
    
3. Regulatory Compliance Risk: If the minimum deposit is intended to meet certain regulatory requirements (e.g. accredited investor thresholds), the current implementation could inadvertently allow users to participate with less than the required USD value, potentially exposing the protocol to compliance issues.

## Recommendation
```diff
function _validateMinAmount(uint256 mintAmount) internal view {
-        require(amountMTokenWithoutFee >= minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit,
-        "DV: mint amount < min");
+        uint256 usdValue = convertToUSD(mintAmount);
+        if (usdValue < minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit) {
            revert MinAmountNotReached();
        }
