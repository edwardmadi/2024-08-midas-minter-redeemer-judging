# Inconsistent Token Usage in Redemption Process will cause Financial Loss for Users

### Summary

Inconsistent token usage in the `RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL` contract will cause financial loss for users as the contract will calculate redemption amounts based on one token but redeem a different token.


### Root Cause

In [`RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL.sol: redeemInstant`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol#L86-L156) the `tokenOut` is set to the token from `buidlLiquiditySource`, but the actual redemption uses the `buidl` token.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to call `redeemInstant` to set `tokenOut` to the token from `buidlLiquiditySource`.
2. The contract needs to have insufficient balance of `tokenOut`.


### External pre-conditions

1. The value of `buidl` token needs to be different from the value of `tokenOut`.


### Attack Path

1. User calls `redeemInstant` expecting to receive `tokenOut` (e.g., USDC).
2. The contract calculates the redemption amounts based on `tokenOut`.
3. The contract lacks sufficient `tokenOut` balance.
4. The contract redeems `buidl` tokens instead.
5. User receives `buidl` tokens, which may have a different value than the expected `tokenOut`.


### Impact

The users suffer an approximate loss due to receiving a different token than expected, potentially leading to financial losses if the value of `buidl` differs significantly from `tokenOut`.


### PoC

1. User calls `redeemInstant` with `tokenOut` set to USDC and expects to receive USDC.
2. The contract calculates the redemption amounts based on USDC.
3. The contract lacks sufficient USDC balance.
4. The contract redeems `buidl` tokens instead.
5. User receives `buidl` tokens, which have a different value than the expected USDC.


### Mitigation

Ensure consistency between the token used for calculations and the token actually redeemed. Modify the `redeemInstant` function to use `buidl` for all calculations and redemptions.

```diff
function redeemInstant(
    address tokenOut,
    uint256 amountMTokenIn,
    uint256 minReceiveAmount
) external override {
    // ... existing checks ...

-   tokenOut = buidlLiquiditySource.token();
+   address actualTokenOut = address(buidl);

    (
        uint256 feeAmount,
        uint256 amountMTokenWithoutFee
-   ) = _calcAndValidateRedeem(user, tokenOut, amountMTokenIn, true, false);
+   ) = _calcAndValidateRedeem(user, actualTokenOut, amountMTokenIn, true, false);

    // ... rest of the function ...

-   address tokenOutCopy = tokenOut;
+   address tokenOutCopy = actualTokenOut;

    // ... rest of the function ...

    _tokenTransferToUser(
        tokenOutCopy,
        user,
        amountTokenOutWithoutFeeFrom18.convertToBase18(tokenDecimals),
        tokenDecimals
    );

    emit RedeemInstant(
        user,
        tokenOutCopy,
        amountMTokenInCopy,
        feeAmount,
        amountTokenOutWithoutFee
    );
}
```
