# The protocol will cause user fund losses due to misalignment between expected and actual token redemption processes

### Summary

The misalignment between the expected token redemption process and its actual implementation may cause temporary loss of funds for users. According to the [`High-level summary: main flows short description - mBASIS redemption vault with swapper`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z3H3cAS1qBAAHqMAyD2YGmSyGzcle9-awrPT9W2NRzY/edit?usp=sharing) documentation: 
> MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper is a contract that is responsible for the redemption of the
mBasis. In regular MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper it can be achieved in 3 ways the same
as RedemptionVault, but with one difference in the instant redemption function:
> - Instant redemption - MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper takes mBasis from the user,
validates conditions, and takes fees. If the contract doesnâ€™t have enough token_out for
complete redemption mBASIS will be swapped to mTBILL according to exchange rates
through the specified Liquidity Provider, then redemption will be processed on mTBILL
redemption vault and token_out tokens from mTBILL redemption transfer to the user.
**Also, BUIDL variant of the redemption vault can be used as an mTBILL redemption vault**

The **mBASIS redemption vault with swapper** should **allow the `BUIDL` variant to perform similarly to the mTBILL redemption vault**. However, the current code does not support all cases when using the BUIDL variant as the mTBILL redemption vault, leading to potential discrepancies and user losses.

Furthermore, the [`README: Q: Additional audit information`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/README.md#q-additional-audit-information) specifies that any discrepancies between the specification and the code are reportable issues.


### Root Cause

In [`MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.redeemInstant()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol), when using [`RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.redeemInstant()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol#L86-L156) as an `mTBILL` redemption vault, the protocol is expected to handle different `tokenOut` options like `USDC` or `WBTC`.

157:                 minReceiveAmountCopy    
158:             );
159: 
160:             uint256 contractTokenOutBalanceAfterRedeem = IERC20(tokenOutCopy)
161:                 .balanceOf(address(this));
162:@>           amountTokenOutWithoutFee = (contractTokenOutBalanceAfterRedeem -
163:                 contractTokenOutBalance).convertToBase18(tokenDecimals);

171:         );

```

However, [`RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.redeemInstant()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol#L86-L156) only processes redemptions with `USDC` as the `tokenOut`. **If a user requests redemption with any `tokenOut` other than USDC (e.g., WBTC), the USDC transferred from the `RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL` gets stuck in the `MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper` contract, and the user does not receive their intended redemption**.

[RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.redeemInstant()#L86-L156](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol#L86-L156)

```solidity

089:         uint256 minReceiveAmount
090:     )
---
098:         address user = msg.sender;
099: 
100:@>       tokenOut = buidlLiquiditySource.token(); //@audit USDC
---
111:         uint256 amountMTokenInCopy = amountMTokenIn;
112: @>      address tokenOutCopy = tokenOut;
113:         uint256 minReceiveAmountCopy = minReceiveAmount;
---
142:         _tokenTransferToUser(
143:@>           tokenOutCopy,
144:             user,
145:             amountTokenOutWithoutFeeFrom18.convertToBase18(tokenDecimals),
146:             tokenDecimals
147:         );
---
156:     }
```

Although the admin has control over the Liquidity Provider to transfer the `mBASIS` back to the user and withdraw the stuck `USDC` for that user, this misalignment between the code and the documentation leads to potential losses for users, as this contract is expected to support all possible cases.


### Internal pre-conditions

There are no internal preconditions for this issue, as users can encounter the vulnerability when interacting with the mBASIS redemption vault with the swapper that integrates with the mTBILL redemption vault with BUIDL.


### External pre-conditions

User needs to redeem using a whitelisted payment token other than `USDC` for this vault.


### Impact

The protocol cause a temporary loss of funds for users due to discrepancies between the expected behavior described in the documentation and the actual implementation.


### Mitigation

Typically, all redemption vaults are designed to support both instant and request-based redemptions and handle whitelisted tokens consistently. Therefore, restricting this vault type to accept only USDC as the whitelisted payment token will reduce the standard vault design's flexibility and prevent users from redeeming other tokens. 

As `BUIDL` is only intended to redeem 1:1 with USDC, as stated in the [`High-level summary: main flows short description - Redemption vault with BUIDL`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z3H3cAS1qBAAHqMAyD2YGmSyGzcle9-awrPT9W2NRzY/edit?usp=sharing), updating the [`RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.redeemInstant()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol#L86-L156) function to validate and handle the `tokenOut` input correctly rather than ignoring it would be necessary.
