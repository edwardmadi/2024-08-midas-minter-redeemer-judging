# Double Fee Calculation will Overcharge Users During Token Redemption in mBASIS Swap Path

### Summary

The redundant fee calculation will cause an excessive fee charge for users as the redemption process will apply fees twice during a single redemption operation when redeeming mBASIS via Swap to mTBILL path.

### Root Cause

In MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol and RedemptionVault.sol (or RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol), the fee calculation is performed twice without proper coordination, leading to double fee charging during the swap path at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/mBasis/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol#L105 and https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVault.sol#L141
Please note there is no mention or enforcement that mTBILL redemption vaults will have mBASIS redemption vaults waived from fee.

### Internal pre-conditions

User needs to initiate a redemption of mBasis tokens when the contract doesn't have enough balance of the requested token.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls redeemInstant function in MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper with a large amount of mBasis tokens.
2. MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper calculates and deducts the first fee.

4. Due to insufficient balance, the contract swaps mBasis to mTBILL using mBasis amount after deducting fee: `amountMTokenWithoutFee`
5. The contract calls redeemInstant on mTbillRedemptionVault with swapped mTBILL from above -`mTbillAmount`

6. RedemptionVault calculates and deducts a second fee at [https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVault.sol#L138-L141](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVault.sol#L138-L141)

### Impact

The users suffer an loss of an additional fee percentage on their redemption amount. The protocol gains this extra fee from users unintentionally.

### Mitigation

Add MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapped  to waivedFeeRestriction for mTBILL redemption vaults on intialization/ updates OR implement a mechanism to indicate internal redemption.
