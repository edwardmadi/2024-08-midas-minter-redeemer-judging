# Front-Running Risks at setRoundDataSafe for CustomAggregatorV3CompatibleFeed contract

### Summary

Link: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/feeds/CustomAggregatorV3CompatibleFeed.sol#L108

The contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks, particularly in the context of the setRoundDataSafe function. Since this function is public, a malicious actor could observe an incoming transaction in the mempool, calculate the deviation, and front-run the transaction with their own price update that results in the victim's transaction being reverted due to a deviation check failure.

### Root Cause

Lack of access control

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Front running attack results in the victim's transaction being reverted due to a deviation check failure.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add access control in setRoundDataSafe function.
