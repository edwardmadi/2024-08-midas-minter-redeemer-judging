# Anyone can block the depositInstant and redeemInstant functions

## Summary
The depositInstant and redeemInstant functions are limited by daily amounts. If this daily amount is passed, the functions will revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
The main issue is `_requireAndUpdateLimit` function which is called in the depositInstant and redeemInstant fuctions.
Consider the following scenario:
A user simply deposits the maximum daily amount using deposit instant and than redeems it using redeemInstant. As a result they will block core contract functionalities for other users rendering the unusable, by paying just small fees.
## Impact
Considering that the attacker should pay fees in order to execute this attack and that there is no incentive for the attacker I believe it should be Medium severity as it will render core contract functionality useless.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using a different strategy for the instant redeem and deposit functions so that such griefing attacks would not be feasible.
