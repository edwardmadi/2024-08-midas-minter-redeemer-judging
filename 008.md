# Lack of Input Validation at _getDeviation function for CustomAggregatorV3CompatibleFeed contract

### Summary

Link: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/feeds/CustomAggregatorV3CompatibleFeed.sol#L231

The _getDeviation function calculates deviation based on the previous and new prices. However, it does not check whether _lastPrice is zero, which could lead to a division by zero. While the function attempts to address division by zero for _newPrice, it does not handle it comprehensively for _lastPrice.

### Root Cause

Lack of input validation.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

An attacker could attempt to manipulate _lastPrice to be zero or a small value, causing unexpected behavior.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add check for _lastPrice
