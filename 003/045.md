# Incorrect Token Amount Calculation in Swap Scenario Will Cause Financial Loss for Users

### Summary

A logical flaw in the [`redeemInstant` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/mBasis/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol#L88-L180) will cause a financial loss for users as the contract will incorrectly recalculate the token amount during a swap scenario, leading to users receiving fewer tokens than expected.

### Root Cause

In [`contracts/mBasis/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol:redeemInstant`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/mBasis/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol#L88-L180) , the recalculation of `amountTokenOutWithoutFee` based on the difference in token balances before and after the swap ignores the original calculation, leading to potential discrepancies.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract's balance of `tokenOut` is less than the initially calculated `amountTokenOutWithoutFee`.
2. The user calls the `redeemInstant` function with a valid amount of mToken.


### External pre-conditions

1. The exchange rates between mToken, mBASIS, and mTBILL are such that the swap is necessary.


### Attack Path

1. User calls `redeemInstant` with a certain amount of mToken.
2. The contract calculates `amountTokenOutWithoutFee` based on the input amount and exchange rates.
3. The contract checks its balance of `tokenOut` and finds it insufficient.
4. The contract swaps mBASIS to mTBILL and redeems mTBILL on the mTBILL vault.
5. The contract recalculates `amountTokenOutWithoutFee` based on the difference in token balances before and after the swap.
6. The recalculated amount is less than the initially calculated amount, leading to the user receiving fewer tokens than expected.

### Impact

The users suffer an approximate loss due to receiving fewer tokens than expected. The slippage protection mechanism becomes ineffective in the swap scenario.


### PoC

1. Alice wants to redeem 100 mToken.
2. The contract calculates that Alice should receive 90 `tokenOut`.
3. The contract's balance of `tokenOut` is only 50.
4. The contract swaps mBASIS to mTBILL and redeems mTBILL.
5. After the swap, the contract's balance of `tokenOut` increases by 80.
6. The contract recalculates `amountTokenOutWithoutFee` to be 80, which is less than the initially calculated 90.
7. Alice receives 80 `tokenOut` instead of the expected 90.


### Mitigation

To fix this issue, the contract should use the originally calculated `amountTokenOutWithoutFee` consistently and ensure that the amount of tokens received from the mTBILL vault meets or exceeds this amount. Here is the suggested fix:

```diff
} else {
    uint256 mTbillAmount = _swapMBasisToMToken(amountMTokenWithoutFee);

    IERC20(mTbillRedemptionVault.mToken()).safeIncreaseAllowance(
        address(mTbillRedemptionVault),
        mTbillAmount
    );

    mTbillRedemptionVault.redeemInstant(
        tokenOutCopy,
        mTbillAmount,
        minReceiveAmountCopy
    );

    uint256 contractTokenOutBalanceAfterRedeem = IERC20(tokenOutCopy)
        .balanceOf(address(this));
-   amountTokenOutWithoutFee = (contractTokenOutBalanceAfterRedeem -
-       contractTokenOutBalance).convertToBase18(tokenDecimals);
+   uint256 actualAmountTokenOut = (contractTokenOutBalanceAfterRedeem -
+       contractTokenOutBalance).convertToBase18(tokenDecimals);

+   require(
+       actualAmountTokenOut >= amountTokenOutWithoutFee,
+       "RVS: actual amount < expected"
+   );

+   amountTokenOutWithoutFee = actualAmountTokenOut;
}
```
