# User can drain contract funds due to incorrect token conversion

### Summary

Incorrect token conversion in the [`redeemInstant` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol#L86-L156) will cause a significant financial loss for the protocol as a user can exploit the discrepancy between 18 decimals and the token's native decimals to drain the contract's funds.


### Root Cause

In `contracts/RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol` the discrepancy between the decimal conversions in `_checkAndRedeemBUIDL` and `_tokenTransferToUser` causes the issue:
- `_checkAndRedeemBUIDL` is called with `amountTokenOutWithoutFeeFrom18` (token's native decimals).
- `_tokenTransferToUser` is called with `amountTokenOutWithoutFee` converted back to 18 decimals.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to call [`redeemInstant`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol#L86-L156) with a valid amount of mTokens.
2. The contract must have a balance of the output token (e.g., USDC).


### External pre-conditions

1. The output token (e.g., USDC) must have a different decimal representation than 18 (e.g., 6 decimals for USDC).


### Attack Path

1. User calls `redeemInstant` with a valid amount of mTokens.
2. The function converts `amountTokenOutWithoutFee` from 18 decimals to the token's native decimals (`amountTokenOutWithoutFeeFrom18`).
3. `_checkAndRedeemBUIDL` is called with `amountTokenOutWithoutFeeFrom18`.
4. `_tokenTransferToUser` is called with `amountTokenOutWithoutFee` converted back to 18 decimals.
5. The contract attempts to transfer an incorrect, significantly larger amount of the output token to the user.


### Impact

The protocol suffers a significant financial loss as the user can receive a much larger amount of the output token than intended, potentially draining the contract's reserves.


### PoC

1. User wants to redeem 1000 mTokens.
2. `amountTokenOutWithoutFee` is calculated as 1000e18 (1000 tokens in 18 decimals).
3. `amountTokenOutWithoutFeeFrom18` is converted to 1000e6 (1000 USDC in 6 decimals).
4. `_checkAndRedeemBUIDL` is called with 1000e6.
5. `_tokenTransferToUser` is called with 1000e18, leading to an attempt to transfer 1,000,000,000,000 USDC.


### Mitigation

Ensure consistent decimal representation in both `_checkAndRedeemBUIDL` and `_tokenTransferToUser`.
