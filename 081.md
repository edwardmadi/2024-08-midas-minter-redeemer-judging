# Let the users specify the minimum amount of tokens they are willing to receive in both Deposit and Redemption vault requests

## Summary
Users aren't able to specify the minimum amount of tokens they are willing to receive in exchange for amount of other tokens, ultimately leading to loss of funds for them
## Vulnerability Detail
This feature is added in both the Deposit and Redemption vault's `instant` functions but not in the request ones. Adding these patterns in the request functions will lead to better user experience and a way to minimize the loses from after a request (request fee, fiat fee, etc.)
## Impact
User isn't allowed to specify the minimum amount of tokens he is willing to receive, leading to bigger losses and unpleasant user experience

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Firstly, add `minReceiveAmount` variable as part of both the deposit and redemption requests, after that put the same logic as in the `instant` functions into `approveRequest` logic, to ensure the minimum loss of funds for the user.
