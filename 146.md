# Overly Strict Token Transfer Amount Validation Causes Unnecessary Transaction Failures


## Summary

The `_tokenTransferFromUser` function in ManageableVault.sol implements an overly strict check for token transfer amounts, which may cause legitimate transactions to fail unnecessarily. This function is being called in core functions like:
1. `depositInstant`
2. `depositRequest`
3.  `depositInstant`
4.  `redeemFiatRequest`

## Vulnerability Detail

The function converts the input amount from `base 18` to the token's decimals and back, then requires that these conversions result in the exact same amount. This check is too stringent and doesn't account for potential precision loss during conversion, especially for tokens with fewer than 18 decimals.

**Code Snippet**
```solidity
    require(
        amount == transferAmount.convertToBase18(tokenDecimals),
        "MV: invalid rounding" //@audit this is too stringent as the precision loss might hinder legit tx
    );
```

## Impact

This strict check can cause legitimate transactions to fail, particularly for tokens with decimals less than 18. Users may be unable to complete deposits or transfers even when the amounts are valid, leading to a poor user experience and potentially locking funds.


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of requiring an exact match after conversion, implement a tolerance threshold for the difference. This allows for small rounding discrepancies while still preventing significant losses due to precision issues. For example:

```solidity
function _tokenTransferFromUser(
    address token,
    address to,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 tokenDecimals
) internal {
    uint256 transferAmount = amount.convertFromBase18(tokenDecimals);
    uint256 reconvertedAmount = transferAmount.convertToBase18(tokenDecimals);

    require(
        amount.sub(reconvertedAmount).abs() <= amount.mul(TOLERANCE_THRESHOLD).div(1e18),
        "MV: rounding exceeds tolerance"
    );

    IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, to, transferAmount);
}
```
