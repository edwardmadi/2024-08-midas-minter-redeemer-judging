# Aggregator feeds can't be controlled by admins because of poor implementation of Access Control

## Summary 
Aggregator feeds can't be controlled by admins because of poor implementation of Access Control, leading to the absolute crash of the system
## Vulnerability Detail
The docs says that the price of `mTBILL` and `mBASIS` will be manually inputed by the admin of the feeds. Thats ok but the `M_TBILL_CUSTOM_AGGREGATOR_FEED_ADMIN_ROLE` and `M_BASIS_CUSTOM_AGGREGATOR_FEED_ADMIN_ROLE` roles are nowhere to be set, meaning that nobody will be able to set the values of both tokens.
## Impact
Nobody will be able to set the price of `mTBILL` and `mBASIS` leading to the complete crash of the system

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
After adding both of the roles in `MidasAccessControlRoles`, grant both roles to the admin in the `MidasAccessControl::_setupRoles()` function like this:
```diff
 function _setupRoles(address admin) private {
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, admin);

        _grantRole(DEPOSIT_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, admin);
        _grantRole(REDEMPTION_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, admin);

        _setRoleAdmin(BLACKLISTED_ROLE, BLACKLIST_OPERATOR_ROLE);
        _setRoleAdmin(GREENLISTED_ROLE, GREENLIST_OPERATOR_ROLE);

        _grantRole(GREENLIST_OPERATOR_ROLE, admin);
        _grantRole(BLACKLIST_OPERATOR_ROLE, admin);

        _grantRole(M_TBILL_MINT_OPERATOR_ROLE, admin);
        _grantRole(M_TBILL_BURN_OPERATOR_ROLE, admin);
        _grantRole(M_TBILL_PAUSE_OPERATOR_ROLE, admin);
+      _grantRole(M_TBILL_CUSTOM_AGGREGATOR_FEED_ADMIN_ROLE, admin);
+     _grantRole(M_BASIS_CUSTOM_AGGREGATOR_FEED_ADMIN_ROLE, admin);
    }
```
