# `ManageableVault` does not provide any function to allow `tokensReceiver` to be updated

## Summary
`ManageableVault` does not provide any function to allow `tokensReceiver` to be updated.
## Vulnerability Detail
`tokensReceiver` in `ManageableVault` is used to receive deposited paymentToken for mToken minting.
The Midas specification stated that the [admin can adjust `Global Parameters`](https://ludicrous-rate-748.notion.site/Admin-can-adjust-Global-Parameters-42afde9e098b42ef8296e43286b73299), which should include the ability to update `tokensReceiver`:
>**Investment recipient address**
>This is the address that receives the funds sent by investors when requesting a subscription (either instant or standard)

However, once initialized in [`__ManageableVault_init()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/abstract/ManageableVault.sol#L177), `tokensReceiver` cannot be updated anywhere in the contract due to lack of a corresponding function.
## Impact
The expected functionality outlined in the specification is not implemented. If `tokensReceiver` is at risk of compromise, the admin has no way to update it without redeploying all smart contracts.

## Recommendation
Introduce a `vaultAdmin-only` function to allow `tokenReceiver` to be updated.
