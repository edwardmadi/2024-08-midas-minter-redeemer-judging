# Some EU sanctions can be easily bypassed

## Summary

The protocol claims to fully comply with German and European Union regulations regarding anti-money laundering, including the adherence to sanctions. However, some EU sanctions imposed in response to Russia's aggression against Ukraine can be easily bypassed using the transfer of mTBILL tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol relies on Chainalysisâ€™s Sanctions List to enforce compliance with sanctions, including those imposed by the European Union. For instance, the EU has imposed "no export to Russia" sanctions, meaning that goods purchased within the EU cannot be exported to Russia. To fully comply with such sanctions, the system should not only enforce sanctions during deposit and withdrawal but also during the transfer of created assets like mTBILL and mBASic.

```solidity
File: midas-contracts/contracts/mTBILL/mTBILL.sol
   82:     function _beforeTokenTransfer(
   83:         address from,
   84:         address to,
   85:         uint256 amount
   86:     ) internal virtual override(ERC20PausableUpgradeable) {
   87:         if (to != address(0)) {
   88:             _onlyNotBlacklisted(from);
   89:             _onlyNotBlacklisted(to); //audit: no sanctioned check
   90:         }
   91: 
   92:         ERC20PausableUpgradeable._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
   93:     }
```

## Impact

Funds can be sent from a sanctioned entity to a non-sanctioned entity that has previously passed KYC and quickly withdrawn, which may lead to legal issues while also negating the operation of the sanctions feature.
Failure to fully respect sanctions could expose the protocol to legal complications and fines, leading to financial losses. Additionally, the protocol contradicts its own documentation, which states that such discrepancies between the specification and the code can be reported as issues.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The implemented modifier to check addresses should be used in `_beforeTokenTransfer` function.

```solidity
onlyNotSanctioned(from);
onlyNotSanctioned(to);
