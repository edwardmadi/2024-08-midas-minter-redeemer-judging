# Some redemption vaults share the same vaultRole, and permission control can not be separated.


## Summary

RedemptionVault/RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL, MBasisRedemptionVault/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithBUIDL/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper share the same vaultRole. Permission control for these vaults can not be separated.

## Vulnerability Detail

`vaultRole()` is the role that controls the entire vault.

```solidity
    modifier onlyVaultAdmin() {
        _onlyRole(vaultRole(), msg.sender);
        _;
    }
```

There are 5 different redemption vaults:

1. RedemptionVault
2. RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL
3. MBasisRedemptionVault
4. MBasisRedemptionVaultWithBUIDL
5. MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper

Among these vaults, 1/2 share the same vaultRole (`REDEMPTION_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`), 3/4/5 share the same vaultRole (`M_BASIS_REDEMPTION_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`). The permission control is done in a centralized contract `WithMidasAccessControl`, meaning if a user has the `M_BASIS_REDEMPTION_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` role, he would have admin access to all 3/4/5 vaults.

This is nowhere written expected in the docs, and may be unexpected.

## Impact

Vaults sharing the same vaultRole means it is not possible to split permission control, e.g. If an user has admin access to `MBasisRedemptionVault`, he would also have admin access to `MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper`.

## Recommendation

Separate the vaultRoles for different vaults.
