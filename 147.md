# In `DepositVault::depositInstant` function `MTBILL` tokens are minted even if the rate of stablecoin (USDC) is out of peg range ### Description

## Summary
In the specification docs, it is explicitly mentioned that `When the token_in is a stablecoin, the minting can only happen if the token_in is within its peg [0.997, 1.003] according to the chainlink oracle`. Whereas this invariant does not hold and `MTBILL` tokens can still be minted even if the rate is below the peg lower bound.

## Vulnerability Detail
[Source Doc](https://ludicrous-rate-748.notion.site/Users-can-instantly-mint-4ee1189194434b2daa7466ae666035d0)
[Source Code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/abstract/ManageableVault.sol#L603C5-L614C6)

I am submitting this report as `High` because in my opinion it breaks the core invariant of the protocol. `MTBILL` is the main pillar of the protocol's tokenomics. If `MTBILL` is minted when it is not supposed to be minted then this could be disastrous.

## Impact
MtBill tokens will still be minted even if chainlink data feed answer is out of the peg range. An attacker may buy the `MTBILL` tokens when the rate is below peg (suppose at 0.8) and then redeem when the rate is above peg (suppose at 1.2) or even within peg (normalize). This way attacker will be able to realize gain that is not intended.

Although that much variation in the data feed of a pegged token like USDC is not that much likely to happen, but previously we have witnessed a lot of disastrous events occured due to Chainlink oracle malfunction. This way our protocol will become vulnerable and if in any point in time something happens to Chainlink data feed (even for some minutes - because bots are ready to snipe), then this vulnerability could probably be exploited. Eventually protocol will bear this loss.

## Code Snippet
I have actually written the PoC using Foundry. I am not that much familiar with TS and Hardhat. So please bear with me.

Code

```solidity
function __deployUSDCMockAggregator() private {   
    usdcAggregatorMock = new AggregatorV3Mock();
    usdcAggregatorMock.setRoundData(99600000); // 0.996 ==> peg range as mentioned in docs [0.997 - 1.003]
}

function __buyMtBills() private {
    
    uint256 investmentAmount = 130_000e18; // USDC amount is mentioned in 18 decimals because of the design of the code

    vm.startBroadcast(WAQAS_KEY);
    IERC20(USDC).approve(address(mtBillDepositVault),investmentAmount);
    mtBillDepositVault.depositInstant(USDC, investmentAmount, 0, bytes32(0x00));
    vm.stopBroadcast();
}

```

```bash

I hope you guys will be able to reproduce. I can also share the whole `MyScript.sol` when requested.

Manual Review
Yes

## Recommendation
Implement the below range check in `ManageableVault::_getTokenRate` function.

```diff
function _getTokenRate(address dataFeed, bool stable)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
        // @dev if dataFeed returns rate, all peg checks passed <=== UNABLE TO FIND ANY PEG CHECK
        uint256 rate = IDataFeed(dataFeed).getDataInBase18();

--        if (stable) return STABLECOIN_RATE;
++        if (stable) {
++            require(rate > minPeg && rate < maxPeg, "Stablecoin rate out of peg range");
++            return STABLECOIN_RATE;
++        }
++        return rate;
++    }

```
