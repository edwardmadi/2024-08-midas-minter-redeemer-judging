# Discrepancy between spec and code: Variation tolerance check does not align with spec.

## Summary

Discrepancy between spec and code: Variation tolerance check does not align with spec.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the [specs](https://ludicrous-rate-748.notion.site/8060186191934380800b669406f4d83c?v=35634cda6b084e2191b83f295433efdf&p=b2d81e54f6bc482ea9fbc889bbfec9ff&pm=s), we can see the variance tolerance check should use `<`, but the code uses `<=`.

> The admin will vastly use a “safe” function to process the subscription. if abs(new_rate/old_rate-1) < minting_variation_tolerance, then the minting can happen via the safe function

*Note: Please note even this issue is submitted, I don't think it's valid, and I don't want it to be, as there is no impact whatsoever. This issue is submitted purely because the readme states "Please note that discrepancies between the spec and the code can be reported as issues".*

```solidity
    function _requireVariationTolerance(uint256 prevPrice, uint256 newPrice)
        internal
        view
    {
        uint256 priceDif = newPrice >= prevPrice
            ? newPrice - prevPrice
            : prevPrice - newPrice;

        uint256 priceDifPercent = (priceDif * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT) / prevPrice;

        require(
@>          priceDifPercent <= variationTolerance,
            "MV: exceed price diviation"
        );
    }
```

## Impact

No impact. Just discrepancy between spec and code.
