# Corruptible Upgradability Pattern

## Summary
The Midas protocol's upgrade mechanism is at risk due to potential storage layout conflicts in its inheritance structure. This issue stems from the absence of storage gaps in key base contracts.
## Vulnerability Detail
Within the Midas ecosystem, several foundational contracts lack proper storage gap implementation. These include:

1. Pausable
2. CustomAggregatorV3CompatibleFeed
3. WithSanctionsList

The above mentioned inherited by contracts with initializer Upgradable pattern or contains initializer itself like  (`CustomAggregatorV3CompatibleFeed`)
These contracts serve as building blocks for more complex contracts like `MTBillCustomAggregatorFeed`, `DepositVault`, and `RedemptionVault`. The absence of storage gaps creates a domino effect, potentially compromising the entire upgrade process.

The intricate inheritance web exacerbates this issue. Each base contract not only affects its direct descendants but also creates a ripple effect through the entire contract hierarchy.

The absence of storage gaps in these contracts creates a vulnerability where introducing new storage variables could lead to storage collision. This collision may corrupt the initial storage layout of derived contracts, potentially triggering severe malfunctions throughout the system's operations.
## Impact
The ramifications of this vulnerability are severe:

1. Storage Corruption: During upgrades, new variables added to base contracts could overwrite existing storage in derived contracts.
2. Functional Breakdown: Critical system functions may behave erratically or fail completely post-upgrade.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
for pausable contracts, if the mapping storage is not necessary, try to remove it or implement it in the pausable-Upgradable contract na shift the gap to be `48` instead of `49`
other contracts mentioned, add for them the Gap as needed
