# Missing storage gap in some contracts might lead to storage corruption

## Summary

[Issue #109](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas-judging/issues/109) from Midas’ previous Sherlock audit was fixed partially. As a result, some old and new contracts can lead to storage being corrupted.

## Vulnerability Detail

Midas’ previous Sherlock audit highlighted an issue where storage could be corrupted due to a lack of gaps in some parent contracts. Although the bug was accepted and a fix [was added by the team](https://github.com/RedDuck-Software/midas-contracts/pull/47), the fix only modified a small subset of all the contracts impacted by the vulnerability. In addition, newly introduced contracts for this audit are also vulnerable to storage being corruped.

The root cause of this issue is a lack of gaps in parent contracts that are expected to be upgradeable, as well as inherited by contracts that also contain storage. In the current version of the code, the following contracts are vulnerable due to missing adding a `__gap` variable to avoid storage collisions:

- [WithSanctionsList.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/abstract/WithSanctionsList.sol#L14)
- [Greenlistable.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/access/Greenlistable.sol#L12)
- [Pausable.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/access/Pausable.sol#L13)
- [CustomAggregatorV3CompatibleFeed.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/feeds/CustomAggregatorV3CompatibleFeed.sol#L16) (Note that no contracts with storage inherit this one, however it is also mentioned to prevent issues in future implementations where child contracts might have storage, adhering to the README’s answer to report issues regarding broken assumptions that could pose risks in future integrations)

As shown in the code referenced for each contract in the list, none of these contracts include a `__gap` variable to avoid storage collisions. However, all of them are parents of contracts that actually have storage variables, and that are expected to be upgradeable. 

All other Midas parent contracts include a `__gap` variable (meaning that preventions have already been added to some of the base contracts, as all Midas contracts are expected to be upgradeable), and given that this was already reported in a previous Sherlock audit where the issue was partially (i.e incorrectly) fixed, meaning that all contracts in the protocol are expected to not be susceptible of causing issues related to storage collisions during upgrades.

## Impact

Medium. A previous issue is still present in the code, which could make storage from contracts inheriting from WithSanctionsList , Greenlistable, Pausable and CustomAggregatorV3CompatibleFeed be corrupted if new variables are added in this contracts during an upgrade.

## Recommendation

Add gaps to the WithSanctionsList , Greenlistable, Pausable and CustomAggregatorV3CompatibleFeed contracts.
