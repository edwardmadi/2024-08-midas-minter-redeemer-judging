# Missing storage gaps in ManageableVault's parent contracts

### Summary

Missing storage gaps in four parent contracts of ManageableVault will corrupt its state and state of its child contracts, if storage variables are added to (or removed from) any of these parent contracts.

### Details

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/abstract/ManageableVault.sol#L28-L34

While their parent and child contracts implement storage gaps, `Pausable`, `Greenlistable`, `WithSanctionsList` have storage variables but do not implement `__gap`; `Blacklistable` does not have any storage variables and does not use `__gap`.


Therefore, if their storage variables are removed, or if new variables are added, it would corrupt the state of ManageableVault and its child contracts, because after such upgrade, variables of child contracts will be pointing to a different storage slot.

Similarly, `mTBILL` and `mBASIS` inherit `Blacklistable`, which does not implement storage gap.

### Root Cause

Missing storage gap in `Pausable`, `Greenlistable`, `WithSanctionsList`, `Blacklistable`.

### Impact

1. Storage of all ManageableVault's child contracts:

- RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL
- RedemptionVault
- DepositVault
- MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper
- MBasisRedemptionVaultWithBUIDL
- MBasisRedemptionVault
- MBasisDepositVault

 will be corrupted if storage of either `Pausable`, `Greenlistable`, `WithSanctionsList`, or `Blacklistable` is changed due to upgrade.

2. Storage of `mTBILL`, `mBASIS` will be corrupted if storage of `Blacklistable` is changed due to upgrade.

### Mitigation

Add storage gaps to `Pausable`, `Greenlistable`, `WithSanctionsList`, `Blacklistable`.
