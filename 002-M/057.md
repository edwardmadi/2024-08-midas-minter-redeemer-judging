# Corruptible Upgradability Pattern

## Summary
Storage of Pausable, CustomAggregatorV3CompatibleFeed, WithSanctionsList will be corrupted and as consequence the Contracts inheriting from them when upgrading
## Vulnerability Detail
Midas protocol has complex inheritance structure in multiple contracts.

Those Contracts are supposed to be  Upgradable-Safe, but due to some contracts in the chain having storage variables without gaps it may get corrupted when getting upgraded.

The contracts that don't have  storage Gaps are Pausable, WithSanctionsList, CustomAggregatorV3CompatibleFeed, 
> _NOTE:!_ mentioned tokens inherit other tokens too which make the upgradable pattern more complex and liable to collision 

And the affected contracts would be MTBillCustomAggregatorFeed/DepositVault/RedemptionVault

Adding new storage variables to any of these contracts can potentially overwrite the beginning of the storage layout of the child contract, causing critical misbehaviors in the system.
## Impact
Storage of affected contracts storage would get corrupted during upgrade

## Tool used

Manual Review
## Recommendation
Add storage gaps on the mentioned contracts in the summary section
