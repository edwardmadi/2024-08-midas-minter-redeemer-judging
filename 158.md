# Redeem functions are protected by `whenFnNotPaused` modifier

## Summary
Redeem functions are protected by `whenFnNotPaused` modifier disabling users to access the funds in the situation that is unfavourable for the user.

In this extremely centralized and power centric protocol, the ultimate user in the protocol is having no power as  `RedemptionVault::redeemInstant`, `RedemptionVault::redeemRequest`, and `RedemptionVault::redeemFiatRequest` functions are protected by `whenFnNotPaused` modifier making users unable to claim what they own actually.

In `Solodit -> Checklist -> Centralization Risk -> SOL-CR-2` it is stated that `Some functionalities must work even when the whole protocol is paused. For example, users must be able to withdraw (or repay) assets even while the protocol is paused.`

## Impact
In case of any unfortunate event or if user feels that he is incurring losses or investment is not adding expected value, in such case when user tries to withdraw/redeem and if the protocol is paused then user will not be able to access the funds for which user is legally entitled.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review
Yes

## Recommendation
Pause modifiers should be removed from redeem functions so that user can withdraw/redeem whenever he feels to.
