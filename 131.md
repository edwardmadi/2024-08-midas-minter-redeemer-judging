https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L319



### External pre-conditions

According to readme:
> The protocol only accepts whitelisted tokens (e.g. USDC, WBTC, mTBILL, mBASIS)

users can use WBTC as payemnt token
increase wbtc'price 

### Impact

loss of funds for protocol

### PoC

**Textual PoC:**
1-user submit a deposit request with token_in's amount 1 wbtc when wbtc'price is 50,000 usd and mtbill's rate is 1:1 its mean user get 50,000 mtbill token
according to specification:
> The admin will usually want to fulfill the subscription and mint the tokens. In that scenario, he specifies an exchange rate. In the vast majority of cases, <ins>the exchange rate used will match the exchange rate from the time of the subscription request.</ins>

2-admin approve request with 1:1 rate and send it to network
3-when approve request tx is pend,wbtc'price goes from 50K to 40K
4-user get 50k mtbill tokens instead of 40k 

### Mitigation
compare current amountTokenWithoutFee with request.amountTokenWithoutFee in `DepositVault::approveRequest`
