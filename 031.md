# Admin's failure to track token amounts will result in inaccurate refunds for users on canceled requests

### Summary

The missing tracking of the `tokenIn` amount in the [`DepositVault::depositRequest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L195-L203) when creating the `mintRequest[]` will prevent the admin from accurately refunding the correct amount back to the user, especially when the deposit token is not a stablecoin (e.g., `WBTC`) that is not pegged 1:1 to the tracking USD value (`usdAmountWithoutFees` and `depositedUsdAmount`).

Since the protocol allows the use of tokens that are not stablecoins (e.g., `WBTC`), without precise tracking of the `tokenIn` amount and its rate at the time of deposit, admins will face challenges in calculating the correct refund amount. They might end up refunding either too much or too little WBTC, depending on fluctuations in WBTCâ€™s value.

The cancel request can be initiated by the admin, and the admin may choose to send the `tokenIn` back to the user separately, as indicated in the link provided in the contest `README`.

> The admin can also decide to cancel the subscription. Ideally, we also have a function that can be called by the admin that flags the subscription request as canceled. In this scenario, no transfer of TOKEN or token_in happens (the admin may send the token_in back to the user separately). Additionally, the fees that were taken remain in the fee recipient address.


### Root Cause

In [`DepositVault::depositRequest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L195-L203), there is a lack of tracking the `tokenIn` amount.

[DepositVault::depositRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L148-L214)
```solidity 
File: DepositVault.sol
148:     function depositRequest(
149:         address tokenIn,  
150:         uint256 amountToken,    
151:         bytes32 referrerId
152:     )
---
195:         mintRequests[currentId] = Request({
196:             sender: user,
197:             tokenIn: tokenInCopy,
198:             status: RequestStatus.Pending,
199:             depositedUsdAmount: tokenAmountInUsd, // tokenIn amount in USD rate at request creation
200:             usdAmountWithoutFees: (amountTokenWithoutFee * tokenInRate) /
201:                 10**18, // tokenIn without fee amount in USD rate at request creation
202:             tokenOutRate: tokenOutRate
203:         });
204: 
205:         emit DepositRequest( 
206:             currentId,
207:             user,
208:             tokenInCopy,
209:             tokenAmountInUsd, 
210:             feeAmount, // fee as in tokenIn amount
211:              tokenOutRate,
212:             referrerIdCopy
213:         );
214:     }
```
Although the emission of `feeAmount` and the tracking of `mintRequests[].depositedUsdAmount` and `mintRequests[].usdAmountWithoutFees` can be used to reverse-calculate the `tokenInRate` at the request creation by:

$\frac{(mintRequests[].depositedUsdAmoun - mintRequests[].usdAmountWithoutFees) * 10^{18}}{feeAmount}$

There is **still an issue for users who are fee-waived (0-fee for operations)** (`waivedFeeRestriction[user] == TRUE`). In this case, the reverse calculation to obtain the `tokenInRate` **cannot be used** because `feeAmount == 0` and `mintRequests[].depositedUsdAmount == mintRequests[].usdAmountWithoutFees`.


### Internal pre-conditions

- The admin needs to call `addWaivedFeeAccount()` to flag accounts for waived fees.

### External pre-conditions

- The admin has the discretion to **cancel** minting/deposit requests and **choose to refund** each canceled request separately.
- The user who created the minting/deposit request is **fee-waived**.

### Impact

Users suffer inaccurate token refunds when the admin cancels a request and chooses to refund, especially if the token is volatile or not pegged to a stable value. This can lead to potential losses for users if the refund amount does not match the original value at the time of the deposit.

### Mitigation

Adding and Tracking of the `tokenIn` amount with out fee in the Request filed and when create the deposti request
