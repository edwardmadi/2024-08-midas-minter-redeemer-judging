# Users receive incorrect amount of token when redeeming

### Summary

`_approveRequest()` in RedemptionVault uses an outdated `tokenOutRate`  from the time of the request this leads to users receiving either more or less funds than they should.

### Root Cause

In `_requestRedeem()` the `tokenOutRate` is saved in a `Request` struct. This rate is then used in `_approveRequest()` to calculate `amountTokenOutWithoutFee()`. see [L331](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/52b77ba39be51f18a5b0736dfbe7f2acbbeba6e3/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVault.sol#L331-L333) in RedemptionVault:

```solidity
            uint256 amountTokenOutWithoutFee = _truncate( 
                (request.amountMToken * newMTokenRate) / request.tokenOutRate, 

```

There is no new rate submitted as with `newMTokenRate` and there is no variation check on it. 

### Internal pre-conditions

A user has to request redeem with `requestRedeem()` and the admin has to approve it with `_approveRequest()

### External pre-conditions

Any change in `tokenOutRate()` from the time the between the request and the approval will lead to either loss of funds for the user or loss of funds for the protocol.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If `tokenOutRate` has increased -> users receive less than they should
If `tokenOutRate` has decreased -> user receive more than they should

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a `newTokenOutRate` parameter to `_approveRequest()` and do a variation check if `isSafe ==true`
