# `minAmount` variable will cause reverts for users in `MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper` flow

## Summary
`minAmount` will cause multiple txn reverts for users that already passing above it
## Vulnerability Detail
First we want to understand `minAmount` 

This is a variable set by the owner as [mentioned here](https://ludicrous-rate-748.notion.site/Admin-can-adjust-Global-Parameters-42afde9e098b42ef8296e43286b73299#:~:text=crypto_redemption.%20Similarly%20to%20the%20minting%20minimum%2C%20we%20want%20to%20limit%20redemptions%20to%20a%20minimum.%20This%20can%20be%20set%20in%20TOKEN.) to limit `very small deposits` 

but this variable may cause problems in `MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper`

Here is How:
1. User wants to redeem `MBasis` for `USDC` from `MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper`
2. this contract has `minAmount` variable to be 2e18
3. the user calls `redeemInstant` with 2e18 (which is > minAmount) and the check will pass in `_calcAndValidateRedeem`
4. Fees substracted from are (for example 50%) and the `amountMTokenWithoutFee`  will be 1e18
5. now the problem happens when we trigger the swapping logic
6. according to the Rate of both tokens we may get returned back 5e17 mToken
7. no [in Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/52b77ba39be51f18a5b0736dfbe7f2acbbeba6e3/midas-contracts/contracts/mBasis/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol#L154-L158) we `redeemInstant` from `mTbillRedemptionVault` with 5e17
8. The problem here would be according to scenarios
   1. If `minAmount` is Global Variable whatever the type of token is, then the user would pass the first `minAmount` but not the second `minAmount` check in `mTbillRedemptionVault` due to rate changes from token to token
   2. if `minAmount` is set unique per every vault(and it takes into consideration the rate of Tokens), then substracting fees from `amountOfMToken` passed in `MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper` would cause a revert in  `mTbillRedemptionVault` `minAmount` check 
    
The above scenario mentioned clearly shows how two `minAmounts` contradict each others

as i see from the invariant Link in the readMe

> The smartcontract would be on list of addresses that have their fees waived for mTBILL. The USDC is then transferred to the user.

Its clearly mentioned to add `MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper` to `waivedFeeRestriction` but nothing about adding it to `isFreeFromMinAmount`

and from the website Docs, we see that `isFreeFromMinAmount` is for special investors and nothing mentioned about this contract being in it like the above `waivedFeeRestriction` mentioned exception
> _Professional Investors under MiFID are exempt from any minimums._
## Impact
multiple txn reverts and core functionality broken
