# Inadequate Minimum Redeem Amount Validation in :: _calcAndValidateRedeem Function

## Summary
The `_calcAndValidateRedeem` function, which is responsible for validating and processing redeem requests, exhibits a critical flaw in its handling of minimum redeem amounts. Specifically, the function fails to ensure that the user receives a sufficient amount of tokens after deducting fees. This discrepancy may result in users redeeming amounts below the acceptable minimum threshold, undermining the integrity of the redeem operation and potentially allowing users to redeem more tokens than intended.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function adds both a percentage-based fee and a fiat flat fee (fiatFlatFee) sequentially. This can result in a higher-than-expected total fee (`feeAmount`), which may lead to a net redemption amount (`amountMTokenWithoutFee`) that is significantly lower than the user's expected minimum receive amount (`minReceiveAmount`).

The function correctly checks whether the `amountMTokenIn` meets or exceeds the `minFiatRedeemAmount` but fails to ensure that the final `amountMTokenWithoutFee` after fee deduction remains above this threshold. This could allow transactions to proceed even when the final redeemed amount falls below acceptable limits.

- Minimum Amount Validation Pre-Fee Deduction: The function checks if the `amountMTokenIn` meets the minimum redeem amount requirements before deducting any fees:

```solidity
if (!isFreeFromMinAmount[user]) {
    uint256 minRedeemAmount = isFiat ? minFiatRedeemAmount : minAmount;
    require(minRedeemAmount <= amountMTokenIn, "RV: amount < min");
}
```
- This check validates that the initial `amountMTokenIn` is greater than or equal to the minimum redeem amount (minRedeemAmount). However, this validation occurs before deducting any applicable fees.

Fee Calculation and Deduction: After validating the minimum amount, the function calculates and deducts the fee:

```solidity
feeAmount = _getFeeAmount(
    user,
    tokenOut,
    amountMTokenIn,
    isInstant,
    isFiat ? fiatAdditionalFee : 0
);
```
The fee is then added if applicable, and the remaining amount is computed:
```solidity
amountMTokenWithoutFee = amountMTokenIn - feeAmount;    <------------ can be below min
```
The flaw arises because the minimum amount check does not account for the deduction of the fee. As a result, users could potentially redeem an amount of tokens that, after fee deduction, falls below the minimum required amount. For example, if the `minAmou`nt is 100 TokenB, and the function validates an `amountMTokenIn` of 1,000 mToken (assuming a 1:1 rate), but the fee amount is 950 mToken, the user ends up with only 50 mToken, which does not meet the minimum requirement.

## Impact
The flaw allows users to redeem token amounts that, after fee deductions, may fall below the required minimum threshold, potentially bypassing the minimum redeem limits.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVault.sol#L483

```solidity
function _calcAndValidateRedeem(
    address user,
    address tokenOut,
    uint256 amountMTokenIn,
    bool isInstant,
    bool isFiat
)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256 feeAmount, uint256 amountMTokenWithoutFee)
{
    require(amountMTokenIn > 0, "RV: invalid amount");

    if (!isFreeFromMinAmount[user]) {
        uint256 minRedeemAmount = isFiat ? minFiatRedeemAmount : minAmount;
        require(minRedeemAmount <= amountMTokenIn, "RV: amount < min");
    }

    feeAmount = _getFeeAmount(
        user,
        tokenOut,
        amountMTokenIn,
        isInstant,
        isFiat ? fiatAdditionalFee : 0
    );

    if (isFiat) {
        require(
            tokenOut == MANUAL_FULLFILMENT_TOKEN,
            "RV: tokenOut != fiat"
        );
        if (!waivedFeeRestriction[user]) feeAmount += fiatFlatFee;
    } else {
        _requireTokenExists(tokenOut);
    }

    require(amountMTokenIn > feeAmount, "RV: amountMTokenIn < fee");

    amountMTokenWithoutFee = amountMTokenIn - feeAmount;
}
```
>In the above code, the logic correctly validates that `amountMTokenIn` meets the minimum required amount for redemption (`minFiatRedeemAmount`). However, it fails to consider the final amount after fee deduction (`amountMTokenWithoutFee`), which could end up being lower than intended.



## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To rectify this issue, the function should validate the minimum amount ***AFTER*** deducting the fees. The corrected approach is as follows:

>Calculate Fee Amount:
```solidity
feeAmount = _getFeeAmount(
    user,
    tokenOut,
    amountMTokenIn,
    isInstant,
    isFiat ? fiatAdditionalFee : 0
);
```
> Deduct Fee and Validate Minimum Amount:
```solidity
amountMTokenWithoutFee = amountMTokenIn - feeAmount;

if (!isFreeFromMinAmount[user]) {
    uint256 minRedeemAmount = isFiat ? minFiatRedeemAmount : minAmount;
    require(amountMTokenWithoutFee >= minRedeemAmount, "RV: amount < min");
}
```
This ensures that the remaining amount after deducting the fee meets or exceeds the minimum redeem amount.
