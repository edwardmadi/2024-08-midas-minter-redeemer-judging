# Wrong implementation of `minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit`

## Summary
First unser MinDeposit should be denominated in usd as mentioned in Docs and logic flow svg, but the current implementation is wrong and will cause min deposit to be much higher for users breaking the core functionality
## Vulnerability Detail
In `DepositVault` we check for users that first time deposit into the protocol if they are depositing the minAmount or not
- seeing from [docs](https://docs.midas.app/token-mechanics/access-midas-tokens/eligibility#minimum-amounts:~:text=minimum%20value%20of-,%24120%2C000,-for%20their%20first) it says that minAmount is 120K USD
- looking at midas-contracts\public\midas_flows.svg it shows that we convert deposited Amount to usd from the DataFeed before we compare it with USD amounts
  
`minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit` code comments at this variable shows that this is min usd deposit.

Now in `_calcAndValidateDeposit` we pass `mintAmount`(which is MToken Amount) to `_validateMinAmount` 

And in `_validateMinAmount` we compare `MToken` amount with `minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit` with out converting the `mintAmount` to usd before comparing contradicting the comment of `_validateMinAmount` function

Now there are two implementation scenarios that will cause that bug:
1. `minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit` is in `mToken`  and this is intended and we would compare mToken to mTokenMin in `_validateMinAmount`
   - The problem here will be that mToken price changes over time and the 120K USD minimum won't be achieved and will cause reverts for users
2. `minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit` is in USD or EUR as some comments says:
   - This will make users deposit 120K mToken amount to pass the check in that function comparing it to the 120K USD
## Impact
according to the two scenarios mentioned above impact would as one of the following
1. volatile min USD min Deposit due to price changes of mToken causing min to decrease or increase according to the price of `mToken`
2. wrong implementation of `minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit` causing breakage of core functionality and reverts for users when they actually deposit the min,

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
convert `mintAmount` to usd before comparing it to `minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit` in `_validateMinAmount`
