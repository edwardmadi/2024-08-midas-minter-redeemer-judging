# `DepositVault` will allow minting excessive `mToken` to User in case of WBTC Depeg event

### Summary

`DepositVault` will allow minting excessive `mToken` to User in case of WBTC Depeg event.


### Root Cause


* The `DepositVault` contract relies on the [USD value](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/abstract/ManageableVault.sol#L609) of deposited tokens to calculate the `mintAmount` of `mTokens`.

* The current `DataFeed` implementation fails to account for potential WBTC depegging.

* This flaw in the price feed causes inaccurate `mToken` calculations, potentially allowing users to mint more `mTokens` than they should receive.

As the severe impact clearly falls on the contract in scope, submitting this issue.


### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

1. `WBTC` depegs from `BTC` from 1:1 ratio, similar to the `USDC` depeg event in March 2023.


### Attack Path


1. Alice deposits `0.1 WBTC` (worth `$6,000` at the time) using the `depositInstant` function.

2. The `_calcAndValidateDeposit` function calls `_convertTokenToUsd` to determine the token's USD value and the current rate.

3. `_getTokenRate` retrieves the value from Chainlink via `IDataFeed(dataFeed).getDataInBase18()`.

4. The `DataFeed` contract is implemented as follows:

```solidity

    function getDataInBase18() external view returns (uint256 answer) {
        (, answer) = _getDataInBase18();
    }

    function _getDataInBase18()
        private
        view
        returns (uint80 roundId, uint256 answer)
    {
        uint8 decimals = aggregator.decimals();
        (uint80 _roundId, int256 _answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = aggregator
            .latestRoundData();
        require(_answer > 0, "DF: feed is deprecated");
        require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= healthyDiff && _answer >= minExpectedAnswer && _answer <= maxExpectedAnswer, "DF: feed is unhealthy");
        roundId = _roundId;
        answer = uint256(_answer).convertToBase18(decimals);
    }

```

5. Since there is no direct `WBTC/USD` Feed available from chainlink on Ethereum and given `DataFeed` uses only 1 feed, it is expected to use `BTC/USD` feed instead.

6. During a WBTC depeg, the `DepositVault` will still receive the unchanged `BTC/USD` value, ignoring the devaluation of `WBTC`.

7. As a result, the `mintAmount` of `mTokens` issued to the user remains inflated, allowing the user to exploit the difference by depositing undervalued WBTC and receiving excessive `mTokens`.


### Impact

Depositors will get excessive `mToken` than intended in case of WBTC Depeg.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Straightforward mitigation is to Update the Chainlink retrieval method to use both the [WBTC/BTC Price Feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/wbtc-btc) and [BTC/USD Price Feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/btc-usd) to derive the accurate `WBTC/USD` price.
