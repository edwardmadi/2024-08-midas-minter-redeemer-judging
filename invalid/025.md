# If fees reaches 100% ( which is allowed ) deposit will never works

## Summary
There are different types of fees as an example by the sponsor suppose the instant mint fee is 95% and the token fee is 5% then the fee percent here is 100%. Even if the fee is > 100% it will be set to 100% which means that the protocol expects it. This will cause the deposit to always revert to this requirement.

```solidity
require(amountUsd > 0, "DV: amount zero");
```
## Vulnerability Detail
If total fees > 100% it will be set to 100% or even if it is 100% the deposit will always revert, due to this requirement
```solidity
require(amountUsd > 0, "DV: amount zero");
```

## POC
```typescript
it('It will revert ', async () => {
      const {
        owner,
        depositVault,
        stableCoins,
        mTBILL,
        greenListableTester,
        mTokenToUsdDataFeed,
        accessControl,
        regularAccounts,
        dataFeed,
      } = await loadFixture(defaultDeploy);

      await depositVault.setGreenlistEnable(true);

      await greenList(
        { greenlistable: greenListableTester, accessControl, owner },
        regularAccounts[0],
      );

      await mintToken(stableCoins.dai, regularAccounts[0], 100);
      await approveBase18(
        regularAccounts[0],
        stableCoins.dai,
        depositVault,
        100,
      );
      await addPaymentTokenTest(
        { vault: depositVault, owner },
        stableCoins.dai,
        dataFeed.address,
        0,
        true,
      );

      await changeTokenFeeTest(
        { vault: depositVault, owner },
        stableCoins.dai.address,
        10000,
      );

      await depositInstantTest(
        { depositVault, owner, mTBILL, mTokenToUsdDataFeed },
        stableCoins.dai,
        100,
        {
          from: regularAccounts[0],
          revertMessage: 'DV: amount zero',
        },
      );
    });
```
