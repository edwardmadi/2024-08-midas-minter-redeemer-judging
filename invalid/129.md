# treating token as decimal 18 even when they aren't lead to loss of fund

### Summary

in the function  **depositVault.depositRequest** the argument **amountToken** is always  treated as decimal 18 even when the token decimal is not 18 which will lead to wrong calculation in the process of converting the token into usd and in line  180 when transferring the token it will lead to transfering only a small amount because  of line 180 function **_tokenTransferFromUser** treats **amountTokenWithoutFee** as decimal 18 and tries to convert it into the original  decimal amount and transfer the token from the user  so if the original amount  is less than 18    the function **_tokenTransferFromUser** treats **amountTokenWithoutFee**  as decimal 18 and tries to convert it into the orginal amount  which will be a small amount 

### Root Cause

in DepositVault.sol line 150 treats the token as decimal 18 even if it is not and tries to convert it into the original value which will lead to transfer only a small amount if the token is less than 18
