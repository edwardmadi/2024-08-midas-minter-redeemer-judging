# MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper will inconsistently apply minimum amount checks, potentially rejecting valid user redemption requests

### Summary

The redundant minimum amount checks for both mBASIS and mTBILL will cause incorrect rejection of valid redemption requests for users as MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper will apply conflicting criteria, leading to discrepancies in request validation, particularly in swap scenarios.


### Root Cause

The choice to perform both mBASIS and mTBILL minimum amount checks in the redemption process is a mistake as it fails to recognize that swap cases should ideally be considered redemptions against mTBILL, leading to potential rejection of valid requests in the initial check.
The first chek will be done here : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/mBasis/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol#L105 and then in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/mBasis/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol#L154

### Internal pre-conditions

1. MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper and mTbillRedemptionVault have different minAmount settings
2. User attempts to redeem an amount that falls between these two minimum amounts
3. MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper needs to perform a swap to mTBILL for the redemption

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Case 1: Request fails after initial check

1. User calls redeemInstant function in MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper with an amount that passes mBASIS's minAmount check
2. MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper determines a swap to mTBILL is needed
3. The swapped amount fails the mTBILL's minAmount check in mTbillRedemptionVault.redeemInstant
4. The transaction is rejected, despite initially passing the mBASIS check

Case 2: Request fails in the initial request

1. User calls redeemInstant function in MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper with an amount that fails mBASIS's minAmount check
2. The transaction is rejected in _calcAndValidateRedeem, even if the amount would have been valid for mTBILL redemption after swapping
3. This rejection occurs despite the fact that swap cases are considered redemptions against mTBILL

Since updates like `_requireAndUpdateLimit` happen on mBASIS only in non swap cases, it might be more apt to do min check should on mTBILL minamount only in swap cases.
### Impact

The lack of a consistent approach to minimum amount checks across different redemption scenarios leads to unpredictable behavior for users. This inconsistency can result in valid redemption requests being rejected, potentially locking users' funds if they cannot meet the varying criteria. Users may face difficulties in understanding why their transactions are failing, as the success of their redemption depends on factors that are not immediately apparent (such as whether a swap is needed or not).


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a single, consistent minimum amount check that applies uniformly across all redemption scenarios, regardless of whether a swap is needed or not. Enforcing MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper  in RedemptionVault exempt from min amount might be one way.
