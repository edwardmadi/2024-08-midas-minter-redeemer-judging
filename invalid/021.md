# First Time Deposit bypassed allowing user to  have amountMWithoutFee <= minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit

## Summary
The `depositInstant` function in the contract fails to accurately identify first-time depositors due to an improper sequence of operations. Specifically, the incrementing of totalMinted[user] occurs before the validation logic intended to enforce stricter rules for first-time depositors. This logical flaw enables users to bypass the intended minimum deposit requirement for their first transaction, leading to potential exploitation and financial inconsistencies within the system.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `depositInstant` function is designed to process user deposits while ensuring that first-time depositors meet a specified minimum deposit amount (`minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit`). However, the current implementation of this function incorrectly increments `totalMinted[user]` before invoking the `_validateMinAmount` function, which checks whether the user is a first-time depositor. The increment operation alters the condition used to identify first-time depositors, causing the subsequent validation to fail in applying the stricter minimum deposit requirement.

The flawed logic can be observed in the following code snippet:
```solidity
    function depositInstant(
        address tokenIn,
        uint256 amountToken,
        uint256 minReceiveAmount,
        bytes32 referrerId
    )
        external
        whenFnNotPaused(this.depositInstant.selector)
        onlyGreenlisted(msg.sender)
        onlyNotBlacklisted(msg.sender)
        onlyNotSanctioned(msg.sender)
    {
        address user = msg.sender;

        address tokenInCopy = tokenIn;
        uint256 amountTokenCopy = amountToken;

        (
            uint256 tokenAmountInUsd,
            uint256 feeTokenAmount,
            uint256 amountTokenWithoutFee,
            uint256 mintAmount,
            ,
            ,
            uint256 tokenDecimals
        ) = _calcAndValidateDeposit(user, tokenInCopy, amountTokenCopy, true);

        require(
            mintAmount >= minReceiveAmount,
            "DV: minReceiveAmount > actual"
        );

        totalMinted[user] += mintAmount;       <----------- First time total Mint of a user already incremented

        _requireAndUpdateLimit(mintAmount);

        _tokenTransferFromUser(
            tokenInCopy,
            tokensReceiver,
            amountTokenWithoutFee,
            tokenDecimals
        );

        if (feeTokenAmount > 0)
            _tokenTransferFromUser(
                tokenInCopy,
                feeReceiver,
                feeTokenAmount,
                tokenDecimals
            );

        mToken.mint(user, mintAmount);

        bytes32 referrerIdCopy = referrerId;

        emit DepositInstant(
            user,
            tokenInCopy,
            tokenAmountInUsd,
            amountTokenCopy,
            feeTokenAmount,
            mintAmount,
            referrerIdCopy
        );
    }
```
```solidity
    function _calcAndValidateDeposit(
        address user,
        address tokenIn,
        uint256 amountToken,
        bool isInstant
    )
        internal
        returns (
            uint256 tokenAmountInUsd,
            uint256 feeTokenAmount,

    {
        require(amountToken > 0, "DV: invalid amount");

        tokenDecimals = _tokenDecimals(tokenIn);

        _requireTokenExists(tokenIn);

        (uint256 amountInUsd, uint256 tokenInUSDRate) = _convertTokenToUsd(
            tokenIn,
            amountToken
        );
        tokenAmountInUsd = amountInUsd;
        tokenInRate = tokenInUSDRate;
        address userCopy = user;

        _requireAndUpdateAllowance(tokenIn, amountToken);

        feeTokenAmount = _truncate(
            _getFeeAmount(userCopy, tokenIn, amountToken, isInstant, 0),
            tokenDecimals
        );
        amountTokenWithoutFee = amountToken - feeTokenAmount;

        uint256 feeInUsd = (feeTokenAmount * tokenInRate) / 10**18;

        (uint256 mTokenAmount, uint256 mTokenRate) = _convertUsdToMToken(
            tokenAmountInUsd - feeInUsd
        );
        mintAmount = mTokenAmount;
        tokenOutRate = mTokenRate;

        if (!isFreeFromMinAmount[userCopy]) {
            _validateMinAmount(userCopy, mintAmount);   <-------------
        }
        require(mintAmount > 0, "DV: invalid mint amount");
    }
```
```solidity
    function _validateMinAmount(address user, uint256 amountMTokenWithoutFee)
        internal
        view
    {
        require(amountMTokenWithoutFee >= minAmount, "DV: mToken amount < min");

        if (totalMinted[user] != 0) return;  <---------- This would never hold!!!! 

        require(
            amountMTokenWithoutFee >= minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit,
            "DV: mint amount < min"
        );
    }
```
The `depositInstant` function calls `_calcAndValidateDeposit` to process deposits. The `_calcAndValidateDeposit` function, in turn, invokes `_validateMinAmoun`t to ensure that the user's deposit meets certain minimum thresholds, particularly for first-time depositors. The _validateMinAmount function is supposed to enforce a stricter minimum for first-time deposits (`minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit`). However, due to the sequence of operations, this validation can be bypassed.

Imagine a user, Alice, is making her first deposit into the system. The platform requires that first-time depositors must deposit at least 100 mTokens, represented by the variable `minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit. `Alice initiates a deposit of 50 mTokens.

Here’s how the scenario unfolds:

*Initial Validation:* When Alice’s transaction is processed, _calcAndValidateDeposit is called to handle the deposit logic. The function calculates various values such as `tokenAmountInUsd`, feeTokenAmount, and mintAmount.

Increment of Total Minted: Before validating if Alice is a first-time depositor, the system increments her totalMinted balance with the mintAmount. For Alice’s case, this increments her totalMinted to 50 mTokens.

*Validation for First-Time Deposit:* Now, `_validateMinAmount `is called to check if Alice meets the minimum requirements for first-time deposits. However, because totalMinted[Alice] is now 50 mTokens (instead of 0), the function mistakenly concludes that Alice is not a first-time depositor. As a result, the stricter validation against `minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit` is bypassed.

*Approval of the Insufficient Deposit:* Since the system bypassed the first-time depositor check, Alice's deposit of 50 mTokens is approved, even though it should have been rejected because it does not meet the required 100 mTokens for first-time depositors.
## Impact
Any user can bypass First Time check in _validateMinAmount`

## Recommendation
To remediate this vulnerability, it is imperative to re-order the operations in the depositInstant function so that the `_validateMinAmount` function is called before `totalMinted[user]` is incremented. This ensures that the contract accurately identifies first-time depositors and enforces the `minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit` requirement
