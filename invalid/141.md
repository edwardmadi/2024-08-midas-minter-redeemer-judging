# The `_truncate` function does not operate as documented

## Summary

The function `_truncate`, which is documented as converting a value to the specified decimals, does not operate as described. Instead, it always returns a value with 18 decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `_truncate` is documented to convert a value to the specified decimals precision. However, in practice, the function always returns a value with 18 decimals, contrary to what is indicated in the documentation.

```solidity
File: midas-contracts/contracts/abstract/ManageableVault.sol
  564:     /**
  565:      * @dev convert value to inputted decimals precision //audit
  566:      * @param value value for format
  567:      * @param decimals decimals
  568:      * @return converted amount //audit:  always 18 decimals
  569:      */
  570:     function _truncate(uint256 value, uint256 decimals)
  571:         internal
  572:         pure
  573:         returns (uint256)
  574:     {
  575:         return value.convertFromBase18(decimals).convertToBase18(decimals); //audit: always 18 decimals
  576:     }

```

## Impact

The functionâ€™s behavior does not directly negatively affect the code but contradicts the documentation. It is used correctly according to its actual functionality, but not as per the documentation. This discrepancy between the specification and the code could lead to confusion and is against the guidelines specified in the project's README. 

As per the README:

> Product Requirements (Specifications). Please note that discrepancies between the spec and the code can be reported as issues.

And according to Sherlock's rules:

> The protocol team can use the README (and only the README) to define language that indicates the codebase's restrictions and/or expected functionality. Issues that break these statements, irrespective of whether the impact is low/unknown, will be assigned Medium severity. High severity will be applied only if the issue falls into the High severity category in the judging guidelines.

## Recommendation

The function's documentation should be updated to reflect its actual behavior.
