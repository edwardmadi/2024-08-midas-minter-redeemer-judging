# Missing Token Rescue Functionality in Smart Contract

## Summary
The smart contract lacks the implementation of a feature specified in the product requirements, which is the ability for the admin to rescue any token and transfer them to any wallet, particularly aimed at retrieving stablecoins provided for instant redemptions, leading to potential asset lock-in and operational limitations.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the product specifications, the smart contract is required to include functionality allowing the admin to rescue any token and transfer them to any specified wallet, a feature intended to ensure flexibility and security by enabling the retrieval of stablecoins or other assets used within the contract. However, upon reviewing the provided codebase, this functionality is absent, indicating a gap between the intended design and the implemented features. This omission prevents the admin from managing assets within the contract effectively, potentially leading to asset lock-in and limiting operational capabilities, especially in scenarios requiring the retrieval of stablecoins used for instant redemptions.
## Impact
It hinders the admin's ability to manage and retrieve assets, which could be crucial in various scenarios, including but not limited to, retrieving stablecoins made available for instant redemptions. The absence of this feature could lead to locked-in assets within the contract, affecting its liquidity and the protocol's ability to adapt to changing conditions or recover from potential issues. 
Also It will help retrieve mTbills sent to the contract during redeem request when those request are cancelled because with current implementation there is no way to retrieve those requests.

## Tool used

Manual Review
```solidity
function rescueTokens(address token, address to, uint256 amount) external onlyVaultAdmin {
    require(token != address(0), "Invalid token address";
    uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient contract balance");

    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(to, amount);
    emit TokensRescued(token, to, amount);
}

```
