# The minimum investment check incorrectly uses the amount of `mToken` instead of its value in USD

## Summary
The minimum investment check incorrectly uses the amount of `mToken` instead of its value in USD
## Vulnerability Detail
Midas doc stated that [a minimum investment is required for first purchasing mToken](https://docs.midas.app/token-mechanics/mtbill/how-mtbill-works/issuance-and-redemption):
>When you purchase mBASIS from Midas for the first time, a minimum investment of 120,000 USDC is required. There are no minimums for the following transactions. 

`minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit` in `DepositVault` is used to store the minimum investment in USD value, which is used for the minimum check:
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev validates that inputted USD amount >= minAmountToDepositInUsd()
     * and amount >= minAmount()
     * @param user user address
     * @param amountMTokenWithoutFee amount of mToken without fee (decimals 18)
     */
    function _validateMinAmount(address user, uint256 amountMTokenWithoutFee)
        internal
        view
    {
        require(amountMTokenWithoutFee >= minAmount, "DV: mToken amount < min");

        if (totalMinted[user] != 0) return;

        require(
            amountMTokenWithoutFee >= minMTokenAmountForFirstDeposit,
            "DV: mint amount < min"
        );
    }
``` 
`amountMTokenWithoutFee` is the amount of mToken instead of its value in USD. As we can see, the above check incorrectly compare the amount of `mToken` to a preset value of `mToken` in USD.
## Impact
- The required amount of assets in USD for the first minting could be far different since `mToken` is not `1:1` pegged to USD 
- The required amount of assets in USD for the first minting could increase over time as the mToken price grows

## Recommendation
Covert `amountMTokenWithoutFee` to the value  in USD before performing check.
