# `_requireAndUpdateAllowance()` not enforced in `redeemRequest()` and `redeemFiatRequest()` in `RedemptionVault` Contract

## Summary
The absence of the `_requireAndUpdateAllowance()` check in the `redeemRequest()` and `redeemFiatRequest()` functions will allow the token amount to be redeemed even if it exceeds the configured token allowance, leading to potential over-redemption.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_requireAndUpdateAllowance()` function checks whether the token allowance is sufficient before proceeding with an operation, ensuring that the allowance is not exceeded. It also updates the allowance by subtracting the amount being operated on. In the `redeemRequest()` and `redeemFiatRequest()` functions, this check is not enforced, allowing these functions to proceed with token redemptions regardless of the allowance configured in `tokensConfig[token].allowance`. This could result in the redemption of tokens beyond the allowed limit.

## Impact
Failure to enforce the `_requireAndUpdateAllowance()` check will allow the redemption of tokens beyond the allowed limit, leading to over-redemption.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the `_requireAndUpdateAllowance()` function is called inside `_redeemRequest()` function to enforce allowance checks 
 and update allowance before proceeding with any redemption operations. This will ensure that the token amount being redeemed does not exceed the allowed limit configured in `tokensConfig[token].allowance`.
