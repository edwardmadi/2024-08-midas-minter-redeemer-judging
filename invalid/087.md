# Allowance Never Decrements Due to Early Return Condition

### Summary

The "_requireAndUpdateAllowance" function in the Solidity contract fails to update the allowance variable because the condition if "(prevAllowance == MAX_UINT)" always evaluates to true, causing the function to return early and bypass the necessary allowance updates.

### Root Cause

In "ManagableVault.sol" The "_requireAndUpdateAllowance" function is designed to skip updating the "prevAllowance" variable, if it equals MAX_UINT. However, since the"prevAllowance" variable is initialized with MAX_UINT in the "addPaymentToken" function, Since this condition is always true, the function never reaches the code that updates the allowance. This means the allowance amount never decrements.

### Internal pre-conditions

1, The "tokensConfig" mapping must contain an entry for the token address.
2, The allowance value in the "tokensConfig" mapping for the token address must be less than MAX_UINT.

### External pre-conditions

1, The "tokensConfig" mapping must contain an entry for the token address.
2, The allowance value in the "tokensConfig" mapping for the token address must be less than MAX_UINT.

### Impact

If the _requireAndUpdateAllowance function fails to decrement the allowance, users or contracts interacting with the token might be able to spend tokens without any limit. This could lead to significant financial loss or depletion of tokens that were supposed to be restricted by the allowance mechanism, potentially resulting in the collapse of the token's economic model or exploitation by malicious actors.
