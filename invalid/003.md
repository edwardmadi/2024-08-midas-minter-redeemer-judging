Functions like depositInstant and depositRequest involve external calls (e.g., transferring tokens). If any of these external contracts have vulnerabilities, an attacker could reenter the function, potentially leading to double-spending or other issues.

### Root Cause

Lack of Reentrancy Protection 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

An attacker could reenter the function, potentially leading to double-spending.

DepositVault Contract: The simplified version of the DepositVault contract includes a depositInstant function that allows users to deposit tokens and mint mToken. This function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it transfers tokens and updates the state (totalMinted) before minting mToken.

ReentrancyAttack Contract: This contract is the malicious actor. It:

Approves the DepositVault to spend its tokens.
Calls depositInstant with an initial token amount.
Exploits the reentrancy vulnerability by re-entering the depositInstant function via the fallback function.
The fallback function allows the attack to continue until all tokens in the DepositVault are drained.
Fallback Function: This is key to the attack. Every time the DepositVault calls back into the attacker's contract (e.g., due to transferring tokens), the fallback function triggers another depositInstant call, leading to reentrancy.

Steps to Deploy and Execute the Attack
Deploy the Vulnerable Contract: Deploy the DepositVault contract.
Deploy the Malicious Contract: Deploy the ReentrancyAttack contract, passing the address of the deployed DepositVault and the token to be used.
Fund the Malicious Contract: Send some tokens to the ReentrancyAttack contract to start the attack.
Execute the Attack: Call the attack function on the ReentrancyAttack contract. This will initiate the reentrancy and drain tokens from the DepositVault.



### Mitigation

To prevent this attack, implement the nonReentrant modifier from OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard, ensuring that functions cannot be re-entered during execution:
