# Allowance Not Decreased in `approveRequest()` Function in `DepositVault` and` RedemptionVaul` Contracts

## Summary
The `approveRequest()` function in both `DepositVault` and `RedemptionVault` contracts does not decrease the allowance after approving a request, which can lead to the allowance limit being surpassed due to the lack of immediate allowance reduction, allowing for additional transactions that deplete the allowance beyond intended limits.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `DepositVault` and `RedemptionVault` contracts, the `approveRequest()` function is designed to approve minting or redemption requests without decreasing the allowance for the corresponding token. This oversight means that even after a request is approved and processed, the allowance remains unchanged, potentially allowing for subsequent transactions to utilize the same allowance, leading to operations that exceed the intended cap set by the allowance. Although administrators can manually adjust the allowance, the absence of an automatic decrease mechanism in the `approveRequest()` function creates a window where the allowance limit can be surpassed if transactions are rapidly executed before manual adjustments are made.

## Impact
This vulnerability affects the protocol's ability to enforce token operation limits, as the allowance, intended to cap minting and redemption operations, does not accurately reflect the utilized amounts. It allows for potential excessive minting or redemption beyond the set limits, undermining the control within the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`approveRequest()` function should automatically decrease the allowance by the approved request amount to accurately reflect utilized allowances and prevent exceeding the intended limits
