# Race Condition Vulnerability in `changeTokenAllowance` Function of `ManageableVault` Contract

### Summary

A race condition in the `changeTokenAllowance` function of the `ManageableVault contract` will cause an unintended bypass of the allowance limit for token operations as an attacker can front-run the transaction that changes the allowance, utilizing the previous allowance before it's updated. In the protocol, the allowance is used to set a cap on the amount of tokens that can be minted or redeemed, serving as a control mechanism to prevent excessive operations. stored as so in the struct below
```solidity
struct TokenConfig {
    address dataFeed;
    uint256 fee;
    uint256 allowance;
    bool stable;
}
```
 This will leading to potential excess minting or redeeming beyond the intended limits set by the updated allowance. 

### Root Cause

In `ManageableVault.sol`, the `adjustTokenAllowance` function
```solidity
function changeTokenAllowance(address token, uint256 allowance)
        external
        onlyVaultAdmin
    {
        _requireTokenExists(token);
        require(allowance > 0, "MV: zero allowance");
        tokensConfig[token].allowance = allowance;
        emit ChangeTokenAllowance(token, msg.sender, allowance);
    }
```
 overwrites the current allowance without considering whether the spender has already utilized it, allowing for a race condition where an attacker can exploit the window between transaction submission and execution to exceed the intended limits by front-running the allowance change transaction.

### Internal pre-conditions

-An attacker monitors the network for transactions that call the `changeTokenAllowance` function.
-The attacker prepares a transaction to utilize the current allowance before the `changeTokenAllowance` transaction is mined.
-The attacker's transaction is included in a block before the `changeTokenAllowance` transaction, allowing them to use the previous allowance.

### External pre-conditions

-The Ethereum network's public and transparent nature allows for transaction monitoring and front-running.
-The attacker has the capability to front-run transactions by offering a higher gas price.

### Attack Path

-The current allowance for a token is set to 1,000,000 units.
-The contract administrator initiates a transaction to reduce the allowance to 500,000 units to tighten controls.
-An attacker, monitoring the network, notices the pending transaction and quickly submits a transaction to mint 400,000 tokens, utilizing the current allowance before the change is executed.
-The attacker's minting transaction is included in a block before the allowance change transaction, allowing them to bypass the new limit.
-After the allowance change transaction is mined, updating the allowance to 500,000 units, the attacker can then proceed to mint an additional 500,000 tokens, exploiting the updated allowance, resulting in a total of 900,000 tokens minted, which exceeds the intended limit of 500,000 units.

### Impact

Allowance limit an be bypassed 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use implementation similar to openzeppelin SafeERC20 on increasing and decreasing allowance
```solidity
function adjustTokenAllowance(address token, int256 delta) external onlyVaultAdmin {
    _requireTokenExists(token);
    TokenConfig storage tokenConfig = tokensConfig[token];
    uint256 newAllowance;

    if (delta > 0) {
        // Increase allowance
        newAllowance = tokenConfig.allowance + uint256(delta);
        require(newAllowance >= tokenConfig.allowance, "MV: overflow");
    } else {
        // Decrease allowance
        require(uint256(-delta) <= tokenConfig.allowance, "MV: underflow");
        newAllowance = tokenConfig.allowance - uint256(-delta);
    }

    tokenConfig.allowance = newAllowance;
    emit ChangeTokenAllowance(token, msg.sender, newAllowance);
}
```
This way limitation set by allowance is enforced.
