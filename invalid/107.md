# Token allowances are not added back if a deposit request is rejected.


## Summary

Token allowances are not added back if a deposit request is rejected.

## Vulnerability Detail

When user requests a standard deposit, the allowance for the token is deducted by `amountToken`, which is the amount of `tokenIn` the user wishes to deposit.

When the request is approved, everything is good. However, if the request is rejected, the allowance is not added back, this would reduce the amount of `tokenIn` that can be used for deposit in the future.

There are two mitigations for this:

1. Add back the allowance if a deposit is rejected. (However, if allowance is reset by admin, it would be a tricky case to handle).
2. Reduct allowance during the admin approval phase instead of user request phase for standard deposits.

```solidity

    function rejectRequest(uint256 requestId) external onlyVaultAdmin {
        Request memory request = mintRequests[requestId];

        require(request.sender != address(0), "DV: request not exist");
        require(
            request.status == RequestStatus.Pending,
            "DV: request not pending"
        );

        mintRequests[requestId].status = RequestStatus.Canceled;

        emit RejectRequest(requestId, request.sender);
    }

    function depositRequest(
        address tokenIn,
        uint256 amountToken,
        bytes32 referrerId
    )...
    {
        ...
        (
            uint256 tokenAmountInUsd,
            uint256 feeAmount,
            uint256 amountTokenWithoutFee,
            ,
            uint256 tokenInRate,
            uint256 tokenOutRate,
            uint256 tokenDecimals
@>      ) = _calcAndValidateDeposit(user, tokenInCopy, amountTokenCopy, false);
        ...
    }

    function _calcAndValidateDeposit(
        address user,
        address tokenIn,
        uint256 amountToken,
        bool isInstant
    )...
    {
        ...
@>      _requireAndUpdateAllowance(tokenIn, amountToken);
        ...
    }
```

## Impact

Allowance would be eventually smaller than expected.

1. Add back the allowance if a deposit is rejected. (However, if allowance is reset by admin, it would be a tricky case to handle).
2. Reduct allowance during the admin approval phase instead of user request phase for standard deposits.
