# Incorrect `mintAmount` Calculation Due to Precision Mismatch in `depositInstant()` and `_approveRequest()` in `DepositVault` contract

## Summary
The `depositInstant()` and `_approveRequest()` function in the `DepositVault` contract does not handle precision correctly when converting the deposited amount into `mToken`. This can lead to incorrect `mintAmount/amountMToken` values, especially when the precision of the input token (`tokenIn`) differs from the precision expected by `mToken`.

The vulnerability causes a $10 worth of an 18-decimal token to mint a significantly larger amount of `mToken` compared to $10,000 worth of USDC.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arises in the `depositInstant()` and `_approveRequest()` functions where the `mintAmount/amountMToken` is calculated by converting the deposited amount of `tokenIn` into USD and then into `mToken`. The conversion process assumes a precision of 18 decimals for `mToken`, but the `tokenIn` may have a different decimal precision (e.g., 6 decimals for USDC).

And the code misses the scaling up the input token amount to the precision of `mToken`.

- **Incorrect Scaling**: If the `amountToken` (input amount) has a different precision than `mToken`, and this discrepancy is not handled correctly, it results in an incorrect calculation of `mintAmount/amountMToken`. 

- **Precision Impact**: For tokens like USDC with 6 decimals, the calculation does not account for the precision difference, leading to inaccurate `mintAmount/amountMToken` values. This results in either an overestimation or underestimation of `mintAmount`, depending on the scaling issue.

### 1. Precision Issue in `_approveRequest()`

In the `_approveRequest()` function, the calculation of `amountMToken` affected by the mismatch between the decimal precision of the input token (`tokenIn`) and the `mToken` (which uses 18 decimals). This can result in an incorrect `amountMToken` value, affecting the token approval process.

### 2. Precision Issue in `depositInstant()`

In the `depositInstant()` function, the calculation of `mintAmount` affected by the difference in decimal precision between the input token (`tokenIn`) and the `mToken`. This could lead to incorrect minting amounts if the token has fewer decimals than `mToken`, potentially resulting in inaccuracies in the minting process.

### 3. Precision Issue in `feeTokenAmount` calculation

Similarly, due to the non-scaling issue mentioned above, the `Fee` is calculated based on the decimals of the input token in the `_getFeeAmount()` function. As a result, when calculating `feeTokenAmount`, the[ `_truncate()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/abstract/ManageableVault.sol#L575) function is used to scale down the input value. This can cause further truncation of the already calculated fee, potentially reducing it inaccurately.

### POC

Let's take the `depositInstant()` function for demonstration.

#### 1. Initial Setup

Assume the following parameters:

- `tokenIn` is USDC (with 6 decimals).
- `amountToken` = `1,000,000` USDC (equivalent to 1 USDC in 6 decimals).
- `minReceiveAmount` = 0 mToken.
- Assume USDC to USD rate (`tokenInRate`) is 1 (i.e., 1 USDC = 1 USD).
- mToken rate (`mTokenRate`) is `0.5 USD` per mToken (i.e., 1 mToken = 0.5 USD).

#### 2. Calculations in `depositInstant()`

**a. Token Conversion to USD:**


  - `amountToken = 1_000_000` (USDC in 6 decimals)
  - `tokenInRate = 1 * 10**18` (USDC to USD rate = 1)
  - `tokenAmountInUsd = (amountToken * tokenInRate) / 10**18`
  - Result: `tokenAmountInUsd = 1_000_000` USD

**b. Fee Calculation (No Fee Due to Waived Restriction):**

- No fee is applied due to waivedFeeRestriction
- `feeTokenAmount = 0`
- `amountTokenWithoutFee = amountToken - feeTokenAmount`
- Result: `amountTokenWithoutFee = 1_000_000`

**c. Convert USD to mToken:**

- `mTokenRate = 0.5 * 10**18` (mToken rate = 0.5 USD per mToken)
- `mintAmount = (tokenAmountInUsd * 10**18) / mTokenRate`
   Here the precision of `tokenAmountInUsd` has not taken into account and its not scaled to match the presicion of `mToken`
- Result: `mintAmount = 2_000_000` mToken

#### 3. Precision Issue

In the `depositInstant()` function, the calculation of `mintAmount` directly uses the `amountToken` with 6 decimals, but `mTokenRate` and `tokenInRate` are scaled with 18 decimals. This discrepancy leads to the following problem:

- **Expected Value**: For 1,000,000 USDC, converting to `mToken` should yield `2,000,000 * 1e12` `mToken` based on the given rate.
- **Actual Value**: Due to the precision handling, the actual `mintAmount` might vary slightly if the tokenâ€™s decimals were not appropriately scaled, affecting the final minted amount, i.e., `2_000_000` mToken.

This precision issue can lead to incorrect token issuance, potentially disadvantaging users.

## Impact
Incorrect precision handling can lead to:
- Inaccurate `amountMToken` calculations in `_approveRequest()`, affecting token approvals and incorrect minting amounts.
- Incorrect `mintAmount` calculations in `depositInstant()`, leading to incorrect minting amounts.
- Sometimes `depositInstant()` will be reverted due to [`minReceiveAmount` check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L106C9-L109C11).
- Sometimes `depositInstant()` and `depositRequest()` are reverted due to checks in [`_validateMinAmount()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L286C9-L293C11)
- The fee charged for a deposit will be extremely minimal.

The issues can result in minting wrong amount of `mToken` and the users will not get enough token while redeeming token by burning `mToken`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adjust the calculations in both functions to handle decimal precision appropriately to prevent financial discrepancies. That means, scale the `amountToken` to 18 decimals before the calculation. And use `_truncate()` to convert to original precision when ever needed.
