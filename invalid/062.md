# 0.997 and 1.003 USDC peg implementation allows for arbitraging

## Summary
usdc is assumed to be 1 to 1 usd at 0.997 and 1.003 rates, allowing for MEV to drain funds by arbitraging the price difference instantly
## Vulnerability Detail
in `ManageableVault` we have function `_getTokenRate`

```solidity
File: ManageableVault.sol
603:     function _getTokenRate(address dataFeed, bool stable)
604:         internal
605:         view
606:         returns (uint256)
607:     {
608:         // @dev if dataFeed returns rate, all peg checks passed
609:         uint256 rate = IDataFeed(dataFeed).getDataInBase18();
610: 
611:         if (stable) return STABLECOIN_RATE;
612: 
613:         return rate;
614:     }
```
Its used to return the rate of the token passed to usd (basically the price) from the chainlink oracle

[in Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/52b77ba39be51f18a5b0736dfbe7f2acbbeba6e3/midas-contracts/contracts/feeds/DataFeed.sol#L107-L109) The checks are that if min and max are 0.997 and 1.003 then the txn don't revert

and in `_getTokenRate` we return `STABLECOIN_RATE` which is 1e18 (rate) if its stable

now the problem is that associated with those flags, a user can do the following:
1. `depositInstant` 200K usdc -> 199,400usd value -> 200,000 USD value of mToken (fees as minimum would be 40 USD)
2. `redeemInstant` 200,000 USD value of mToken (fees as minimum would be 40 USD) -> 200,000 USD value of FIAT
   - or he can redeem it for 200K USD value of WBTC
    
This is clearly leakage of value as this can be repeated multiple times.

**Constraints** are low fees of the protocol, the user being `greenlisted` or `greenlistEnabled` is false, the peg is not very close to 1 to 1

All values above are viable scenarios described by the protocol in their readMe and their Notion link

Txn fees are accounted for as l2 (ie arbitrum, thats why i neglected it)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
return the usdc -> usd rate and account the amount with it, don't assume the 1 to 1 cause it will lead to arbitraging and leakage of funds
