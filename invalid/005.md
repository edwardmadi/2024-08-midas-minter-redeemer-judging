The rates for mToken and the output token are fetched via the _convertMTokenToUsd and _convertUsdToToken functions during a transaction. If there is a delay between fetching these rates and performing the final transfer, an attacker could manipulate the price feed data (if it's not secured) to benefit from the price difference.

### Root Cause

Price manipulation

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

An attacker could manipulate the price feed data (if it's not secured) to benefit from the price difference.

        // Step 4: Reset the price to legitimate value
        vulnerableContract.updatePrice(legitimatePrice);

        // Step 5: Transfer the bought tokens to the attacker

```
Deploy the VulnerableContract with an initial price (e.g., 1 Ether per token).
Deploy the FrontRunningAttacker contract with references to the VulnerableContract and the token contract.
The attacker observes a legitimate user's transaction to buy tokens at the current price.
The attacker calls frontRun to:
Manipulate the price to a lower value using manipulatePrice.
Buy tokens at the manipulated, lower price.
Reset the price to the original value.
The legitimate user's transaction is executed, but the price has already been restored, so they receive fewer tokens than expected, while the attacker profits from the difference.

### Mitigation

Mitigation: Consider using Chainlink’s latestAnswer with a time-weighted average price (TWAP) or implementing a check to ensure the rate hasn’t drastically changed between the time it was first fetched and when the transfer occurs.
