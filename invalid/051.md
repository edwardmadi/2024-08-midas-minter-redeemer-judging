# Users will receive incorrect amounts of `mTokens due to inconsistent handling of token decimals

### Summary

Inconsistent handling of token decimals for USDC (6 decimals) and WBTC (8 decimals) will cause an incorrect calculation of mToken amounts for users as the contract assumes all token amounts are in 18 decimals, regardless of the actual token decimals.

The protocol team mentioned that in README that:
> The protocol only accepts whitelisted tokens (e.g. USDC, WBTC, mTBILL, mBASIS

### Root Cause

In [contracts/DepositVault.sol:69-105](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L96-L105) and [contracts/DepositVault.sol:369-372](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L369-L372), the contract fails to normalize token amounts to 18 decimals before performing calculations, leading to incorrect USD and mToken amount calculations.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. USDC (6 decimals) or WBTC (8 decimals) needs to be used for deposit.
2. User needs to call [`depositInstant()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L78-L144) or [`depositRequest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L148-L214) with either USDC or WBTC.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `depositInstant()` with either 1,000,000 USDC (6 decimals, equivalent to $1,000,000) or 1 WBTC (8 decimals, equivalent to ~$30,000 assuming 1 BTC = $30,000).
2. `_calcAndValidateDeposit()` is called, which retrieves the token's decimals (6 for USDC, 8 for WBTC) but doesn't use it.
3. `_convertTokenToUsd()` treats the input amount as if it were in 18 decimals.
4. The function calculates USD amount as if 1,000,000 * 10^18 USDC or 1 * 10^18 WBTC were deposited.
5. This results in a grossly overestimated USD amount for USDC and a slightly overestimated amount for WBTC.
6. Based on these incorrect USD amounts, excessive amounts of mTokens are minted to the user.

### Impact

The protocol suffers significant losses as users can receive up to 10^12 times more mTokens than they should for USDC and 10^10 times more for WBTC. The attacker gains these excess amounts of mTokens.

### PoC

Scenario 1: Alice deposits 1,000,000 USDC (equivalent to $1,000,000):

1. Alice calls `depositInstant(USDC_ADDRESS, 1000000, minReceiveAmount, referrerId)`.
2. In `_calcAndValidateDeposit()`:
   - `tokenDecimals = 6` (for USDC)
   - `amountToken = 1000000`
3. In `_convertTokenToUsd()`:
   - `amount = 1000000` (treated as 18 decimals)
   - `rate = 1 * 10^18` (assuming 1 USDC = 1 USD)
   - `amountInUsd = (1000000 * 10^18 * 1 * 10^18) / 10^18 = 1000000 * 10^18`
4. This incorrectly calculates that Alice deposited $1,000,000 * 10^18 worth of USDC.
5. mTokens are minted based on this grossly overestimated amount.

Scenario 2: Bob deposits 1 WBTC (equivalent to ~$30,000):

1. Bob calls `depositInstant(WBTC_ADDRESS, 100000000, minReceiveAmount, referrerId)`.
2. In `_calcAndValidateDeposit()`:
   - `tokenDecimals = 8` (for WBTC)
   - `amountToken = 100000000` (1 WBTC)
3. In `_convertTokenToUsd()`:
   - `amount = 100000000` (treated as 18 decimals)
   - `rate = 30000 * 10^18` (assuming 1 WBTC = $30,000)
   - `amountInUsd = (100000000 * 30000 * 10^18) / 10^18 = 3000000000000000`
4. This incorrectly calculates that Bob deposited $3,000,000,000,000,000 worth of WBTC.
5. mTokens are minted based on this grossly overestimated amount.


### Mitigation

To fix this issue, we need to normalize the token amount to 18 decimals before performing calculations. Here's the proposed fix:

```diff
function _convertTokenToUsd(address tokenIn, uint256 amount, uint256 tokenDecimals)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256 amountInUsd, uint256 rate)
{
    require(amount > 0, "DV: amount zero");

    TokenConfig storage tokenConfig = tokensConfig[tokenIn];

    rate = _getTokenRate(tokenConfig.dataFeed, tokenConfig.stable);
    require(rate > 0, "DV: rate zero");

++  // Normalize amount to 18 decimals
++  uint256 normalizedAmount = amount * 10**(18 - tokenDecimals);

--  amountInUsd = (amount * rate) / (10**18);
++  amountInUsd = (normalizedAmount * rate) / (10**18);
}
```

Also, update the `_calcAndValidateDeposit` function to pass the `tokenDecimals`:

```diff
(uint256 amountInUsd, uint256 tokenInUSDRate) = _convertTokenToUsd(
    tokenIn,
    amountToken,
++  tokenDecimals
);
```
