# The price of the stable token is overestimated, allowing users to profit from it

## Summary
The protocol sets the price of stablecoins to `1e18`, but in reality, the price of stablecoins fluctuates. This could lead to an overestimation of the token's value. Users could deposit stablecoins to get mTokens and then redeem them for other tokens, potentially profiting from this discrepancy.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_getTokenRate()` function, if the token is a stablecoin, the rate is set to `1e18`. 
```solidity
  function _getTokenRate(address dataFeed, bool stable)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
        // @dev if dataFeed returns rate, all peg checks passed
        uint256 rate = IDataFeed(dataFeed).getDataInBase18();

        if (stable) return STABLECOIN_RATE;

        return rate;
    }

```

This rate is then used to calculate the value of the stablecoin.
```solidity
    rate = _getTokenRate(tokenConfig.dataFeed, tokenConfig.stable);
        require(rate > 0, "DV: rate zero");

        amountInUsd = (amount * rate) / (10**18);
```


 The protocol supports USDT, a stablecoin whose price fluctuates and is not always exactly `1e18`. (https://etherscan.io/address/0x3E7d1eAB13ad0104d2750B8863b489D65364e32D#readContract). If the price of USDT is less than `1e18`, the value of the token is overestimated. As a result, if a user deposits USDT (which is overestimated), they could redeem it later for another token, potentially exploiting this discrepancy for profit.

## Impact
The price of the stablecoin may be overestimated, allowing users to potentially profit from this.
