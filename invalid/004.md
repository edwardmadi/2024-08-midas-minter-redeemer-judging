# No Protection Against Flash Loan Attacks at redeemInstnt function for RedemptionVault contract

### Summary
Line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVault.sol#L124
The contract does not have explicit protections against flash loan attacks, which could allow an attacker to manipulate token prices or exploit the rate conversion logic within a single transaction.

### Root Cause

Price manipulation

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Attacker can manipulate token prices or exploit the rate conversion logic within a single transaction.

```
Deploy VulnerableContract with a normal price of 1 unit.
Deploy FlashLoanAttacker with references to the flash loan provider, the vulnerable contract, and the token contract.
Execute the executeFlashLoan function on the FlashLoanAttacker contract, which will:
Borrow tokens via a flash loan.
Manipulate the price in the vulnerable contract.
Buy tokens at the manipulated price.
Repay the flash loan.
Profit from the price difference.
Summary of the Attack Flow
The attacker borrows tokens through a flash loan.
The attacker inflates the price of the token in the VulnerableContract by manipulating the oracle.
The attacker buys a large amount of tokens at the manipulated price.
The attacker then resets the price to its original value.
The attacker repays the flash loan and profits from the difference in token value.

Security Mitigations: The primary defense against such attacks involves using a reliable oracle that cannot be easily manipulated within a single transaction (e.g., time-weighted average price oracles).
Practical Implementation: In a real-world scenario, this would require integration with existing flash loan providers like Aave, dYdX, or Uniswap, and using actual token contracts.
