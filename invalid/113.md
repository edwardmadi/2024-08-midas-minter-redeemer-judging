# DOS to `DepositVault.depositInstant` and `DepositVault.depositRequest`

## Summary

The issue occurs with wBTC as token In during instant deposit or deposit request. Even though it will happen on tokens < 18 decimals, the USDC with 6 decimals doesn't have a big issue due to the stable token price, but with BTC's volatile price,  it is an issue. Just add truncation to `amount without fee` calculation on deposit functions (`_tokenTransferFromUser`, `_tokenTransferFromTo`, `_tokenTransferToUser`) from [ManageableVault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/52b77ba39be51f18a5b0736dfbe7f2acbbeba6e3/midas-contracts/contracts/abstract/ManageableVault.sol#L393-L460) . Look at recommendation for easier understanding.

They move tokens between the user and token receivers or vaults. And it implements a strict rounding between token decimals and base 18 decimals during converting. It is done to combat minting token for free using rounding down issue. It was in past [contest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas-judging/issues/108).

But this strict rounding demands the token amounts with 6 or 8 decimals to be in whole amounts. (example : 100.5566778899 amount in USDC will be 100556677, but in base 18 the amount will be 100556677889900000000 ). You will get full precision, so if the input amount is 100556677889900000000 on Line 395 below, then line 402 will revert due to this wrong rounding because the rounding will turn `100556677889900000000` into `100556677000000000000` because `100556677889900000000` becomes 100556677, then it is converted back to 18 decimals becoming `100556677000000000000`, hence on line 402 comparing `100556677889900000000` == `100556677000000000000` will revert. 

## Vulnerability Detail

This is intended and accordingly, wherever these token transfer functions are used, the amounts are truncated on L581 before calling Line 394, meaning whatever the dust like `100556677889900000000` will become `100556677000000000000` and no revert will be triggered. They are done on [MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.redeemInstant](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/52b77ba39be51f18a5b0736dfbe7f2acbbeba6e3/midas-contracts/contracts/mBasis/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol#L121-L132) & [RedemptionVault.redeemInstant](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/52b77ba39be51f18a5b0736dfbe7f2acbbeba6e3/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVault.sol#L159-L173) & [RedemptionVault.approveRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/52b77ba39be51f18a5b0736dfbe7f2acbbeba6e3/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVault.sol#L331-L336) & [RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.redeemInstant](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/52b77ba39be51f18a5b0736dfbe7f2acbbeba6e3/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol#L137-L142) and other redemption transfer that transfer mTokens doesn't need truncation becasue mtokens are 18 decimals and no rounding happens.


In the above example, the USDC example is not an issue at all, the frontend can handle to only allow tokens in whole decimals like 10 20 22 25 and not in 22.25845 USDC, and the price of stable coins is always 1e18, so no issue. But when it comes to WBTC with 8 decimals, the value of 10_000 units is $6.5 at 65000 per btc and the price is volatile every minute. There are places where token transfers are done without truncation, example at [DepositVault.depositInstant](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/52b77ba39be51f18a5b0736dfbe7f2acbbeba6e3/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L115-L128) and [DepositVault.depositRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/52b77ba39be51f18a5b0736dfbe7f2acbbeba6e3/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L180-L193). Both these functions pull tokens twice, one is truncated fee amount and transfer is done without revert and other transfer is `amountWithoutFee` which is not at all truncated and it is where revert happens.

It's a DOS to users because they have to input amounts exactly that don't get reverted due to rounding, and if fee is on for WBTC, then it will be more difficult to input the amounts after truncated fee subtraction, the amount without fee has to in a way that doesn't revert on line 402 below. Example : at exactly 65000$ per btc, if user wants to mint 1000 USD worth mToken, then the input amount will be 15384615380000000, but in actual btc amount it will be only `1538461` or 0.01538461538 wBTC. And 0.01% of btc fee amount subtraction along with volatile price change, the computation of exact amount without reverting is not possible. The solution is to be okay with truncating `amount without fee` and minting the mToken.

## Impact
Deposit insatnt and deposit request are important functions of protcol and half eh functions facing user is depositing the tokens, so reverts in there is a DOS to core functionality. But occurs only in volatile tokens with <18 decimals, so giving it a medium.
