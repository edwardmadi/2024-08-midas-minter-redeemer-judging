# The oracle is missing the stablecoin peg check, which may cause the protocol to be compromised.

### Summary

[The document ](https://ludicrous-rate-748.notion.site/Users-can-instantly-redeem-b5e16e291d784af9bb250b4a2013a542)explains that if the price of the stable currency exceeds a certain range, it cannot be exchanged. But there is no peg check in the contract. Moreover, the protocol will always use 1 USD as the price of the stablecoin. If the stablecoin is decoupled, arbitrage may be carried out through this protocol, posing a threat to the protocol.
> When the token_out is a stablecoin, the minting can only happen if the token_out is within its peg [0.997, 1.003] according to the chainlink oracle, and we apply 1 stablecoin = 1 USD for the exchange rate. We need to anticipate that we may have to ingest other price feeds on other EVM chains.

### Root Cause

[The contract is missing the stablecoin peg check and always treats the stablecoin price as 1.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/52b77ba39be51f18a5b0736dfbe7f2acbbeba6e3/midas-contracts/contracts/abstract/ManageableVault.sol#L609-L613)

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Stablecoin prices are decoupled.

### Attack Path

Assuming the USDC price is decoupled, its market price is much higher than 1USD.
The protocol still treats its price as 1USD.

The attacker deposits BTC to obtain mToken, and then uses the mToken to redeem USDC. In this way, USDC will still be settled according to 1USD, and the attacker will obtain more USDC, and then sell it in the market to make a profit. The final total USDC value is greater than the initial total BTC value. The protocol lost more USDC.

### Impact

The protocol may result in loss of funds.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Add stablecoin peg check, and it is better to use real USD price, do not use 1 directly.
