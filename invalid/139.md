# System can be bricked for a while

## Summary
Root cause: lack of a function to modify `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer`

## Vulnerability Detail

Both `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` are set in the initializer at start , then these state can never be upgraded because it lacks the setter function that can upgrade them. If the data feed is for a normal tokenIn and out token, then those state can only be upgraded by removing the token with old data feed and adding the token again with new data feed that has updated min and max values.

If the data feed is used for a mToken, then the issue has more impact if mToken surges/plunges so large breaking these min/max limits, then the min/max values cannot be updated because `mTokenDataFeed` state from deposit/redemption vault also doesn't have a setter function to update the vault to a new data feed. So, if the mToken is volatile or any tokenIn/Out is deemed volatile to break the limits, then its better to have a setter to change these values.

The final solution might be to upgrade the vault to a new implementation that has those setter functions, but that is not the way to do it because the system will be bricked till the update, and this contest scope is focussed on this implementation only.

```solidity
CustomAggregatorV3CompatibleFeed.sol

    //@notice minimal possible answer that feed can return
    int192 public minAnswer;

    // @notice maximal possible answer that feed can return
    int192 public maxAnswer;

83:     function initialize(
84:         address _accessControl,
85:         int192 _minAnswer,
86:         int192 _maxAnswer,
---- SNIP ----
89:     ) external initializer {
---- SNIP ----
98:    >>>  minAnswer = _minAnswer;
99:    >>>  maxAnswer = _maxAnswer;
100:         maxAnswerDeviation = _maxAnswerDeviation;
101:         description = _description;
102:     }

```

## Impact
System can be bricked if answers hit the `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` due to lack of setter function that updates these min/max answers state.

## Recommendation

Add this function to the feed.
```solidity
    function setAnswers(int192 _minAnswer, int192 _maxAnswer) public onlyAggregatorAdmin {
        maxAnswer = _maxAnswer;
        minAnswer = _minAnswer;
    }
```
