# precision loss in  the `_checkAndRedeemBUIDL` function

### Details

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol#L164C14-L164C34

in the `_checkAndRedeemBUIDL` function there is a potential precision loss and incorrect calculation when converting between different token decimals. The function assumes that `buidlToRedeem` (calculated as the difference between `amountTokenOut` and `contractBalanceTokenOut`) has the same decimal precision as the BUIDL token. However, this may not be true if the output token (USDC) and BUIDL have different decimal places.

This can lead to situations where:
1. The amount of BUIDL redeemed is less than necessary, causing the transaction to fail due to insufficient funds.
2. More BUIDL is redeemed than needed, potentially leaving excess BUIDL in the contract.


1. The function doesn't account for potential differences in decimal places between USDC (typically 6 decimals) and BUIDL (which could be 18 decimals, though not explicitly stated in the code).

2. The `amountTokenOut` parameter is passed in with the USDC token's decimal precision, but it's used directly to interact with the BUIDL token without any decimal adjustment.

### PoC:

Let's assume USDC has 6 decimals and BUIDL has 18 decimals. Here's a potential flow:

1. User requests to redeem 1000 USDC (1000 * 10^6 = 1,000,000,000 in USDC's smallest unit).
2. The contract has 900 USDC available.
3. The function calculates: buidlToRedeem = 1,000,000,000 - 900,000,000 = 100,000,000

4. It then tries to redeem 100,000,000 BUIDL tokens, which is actually only 0.0001 BUIDL (100,000,000 / 10^18).

5. This amount of BUIDL is likely much less than 100 USDC when redeemed, causing the transaction to fail due to insufficient funds.

### The impact :

1. Failed transactions, preventing users from redeeming their tokens.
2. In a worst-case scenario, if the BUIDL price is very low compared to USDC, it might redeem successfully but provide far less USDC than expected, potentially leading to significant loss of funds for users.


### Mitigation

To fix this, the function should:

1. Convert all amounts to a common precision (e.g., 18 decimals) before calculations.
2. Adjust the `buidlToRedeem` amount based on the decimal difference between USDC and BUIDL.
3. Ensure that the final amount of USDC received after BUIDL redemption is sufficient to cover the user's request.
