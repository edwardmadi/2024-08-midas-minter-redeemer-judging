# Users lose fund if request is rejected by admin

### Summary

Users are not refunded if a request is rejected which leads to loss of funds for users when the `vaultAdmin` rejects a request 

### Root Cause

In both DepositVault and RedeemVault users are not refunded when the vault admin calls `rejectRequest()` but the user's funds have already been taken when the user calls `depositRequest()` or `redeemRequest()`.  See [L247](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/52b77ba39be51f18a5b0736dfbe7f2acbbeba6e3/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVault.sol#L247-L255), there is no refund.

```solidity
    function rejectRequest(uint256 requestId) external onlyVaultAdmin {
        Request memory request = redeemRequests[requestId];

        _validateRequest(request.sender, request.status);

        redeemRequests[requestId].status = RequestStatus.Canceled;

        emit RejectRequest(requestId, request.sender);
    }

```
