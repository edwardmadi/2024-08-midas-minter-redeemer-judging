# Rejected redemption requests will result in permanently lost mTokens

### Summary

The lack of a token return mechanism for rejected redemption requests will cause a permanent loss of funds for users as administrators will reject requests without returning the locked mTokens.

### Root Cause

In the RedemptionVault contract, the choice to not include a token return mechanism in the rejectRequest function will leave user funds permanently locked in the contract when a redemption request is rejected.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User calls redeemRequest or redeemFiatRequest which transfers mTokens to the contract
2. Administrator calls rejectRequest and changes the request status to Canceled

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls redeemRequest or redeemFiatRequest, transferring mTokens to the contract
2. Administrator calls rejectRequest for the user's request
3. The request status is changed to Canceled, but mTokens remain in the contract
4. User has no way to retrieve their mTokens

### Impact

The users suffer a complete loss of the mTokens locked in rejected redemption requests.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the rejectRequest function to return mTokens to the user (perhaps ok to retain fees) or implement a separate claim function for rejected requests:
