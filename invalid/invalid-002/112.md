# Funds Not Returned to User on `rejectRequest` Execution, which lead to loss user it's funds.

## Summary
### Description:

In the `DepositVault` contract, when a user submits a deposit request via the `depositRequest` function, tokens and fees are transferred from the user to the contract. The request remains in a `Pending` status until a vault administrator either approves or rejects it.

However, if the request is rejected by the admin using the `rejectRequest` function, the transferred funds are not returned to the user. The function simply updates the request status to `Canceled` without triggering any refund. This behavior could result in users losing their funds, leading to a potential loss of user trust and a breach of expected contract functionality.

If admin send the funds directly it will also lead to different problem and loss of funds. here is the reason.

When the request is create when `depositRequest` function get call the request struct is initialize this way in the function.

```solidity
mintRequests[currentId] = Request({
            sender: user,
            tokenIn: tokenInCopy,
            status: RequestStatus.Pending,
            depositedUsdAmount: tokenAmountInUsd,
            usdAmountWithoutFees: (amountTokenWithoutFee * tokenInRate) /
                10**18,
            tokenOutRate: tokenOutRate
        });
```

here in the struct the deposit token is store, amount of that token in usd store and the amount of token in usd without fee is store. at the end it store the mToken price at the time of function calls. the issue here is that the struct doesn't store the tokenInRate mean the rate of deposit token at the request time. when admin reject request and then try to send back the token amount to user it has request with specific id for that user but in that request struct it doesn't store the deposit token amount and doesn't store the deposit token rate on the time of request. admin only has token type and value in usd of deposit token since it's common that deposit token price will change  in market (up/down as crypto market). now admin should transfer stored token in amount of usd value that store. now admin should transfer the token in new price feed which will be lead to user loss of funds if price of that token goes down. 

summary: 

1- admin will transfer the token when it's value is goes very low then the time when the `depositRequest` and `rejectRequest` which will be very bad for user.

2- admin will transfer the amount very late which will also minimize the user trust on protocol.


## Impact
- **Financial Loss**: Users who submit deposits may lose their funds if their request is rejected since there is no mechanism in place to refund their initial deposit amount.
- **Loss of Trust**: Users may perceive this as malicious or negligent behavior by the contract developers, reducing trust in the platform.

## Code Snippet
note: when the depositRequest function is get call the request struct has not store the tokenInRate variable which is 
necessary when admin transfer directly to admin wallet that token should be in that rate or should be near to that rate.

note: When admin want to reject the request the refund is not done.

## Recommendation

### Mitigation Steps:

**step 1:**

To address this issue, the contract should be modified to include a refund mechanism when a request is rejected. Specifically:

- In the `rejectRequest` function, after updating the request status to `Canceled`, the contract should transfer the user's original deposit amount back to them.

**Updated `rejectRequest` Function:**
```solidity
function rejectRequest(uint256 requestId) external onlyVaultAdmin {
    Request memory request = mintRequests[requestId];

    require(request.sender != address(0), "DV: request not exist");
    require(
        request.status == RequestStatus.Pending,
        "DV: request not pending"
    );

    mintRequests[requestId].status = RequestStatus.Canceled;

    // Refund the user's deposited amount
++   _tokenTransferToUser(request.tokenIn, request.sender, request.usdAmountWithoutFees);
    emit RejectRequest(requestId, request.sender);
}
```

**step2:**

add tokenInRate property to struct. to store the price of token at the time of `depositRequest` function call. and then admin should transfer the token directly to user according to the price in which the request is created. which will provide from user loss of funds.

```solidity
mintRequests[currentId] = Request({
            sender: user,
            tokenIn: tokenInCopy,
            status: RequestStatus.Pending,
            depositedUsdAmount: tokenAmountInUsd,
            usdAmountWithoutFees: (amountTokenWithoutFee * tokenInRate) /
                10**18,
            tokenOutRate: tokenOutRate

+ tokenInRate: tokenInRate
        });
```
