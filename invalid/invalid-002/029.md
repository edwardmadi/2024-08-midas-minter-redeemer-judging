# Users requests that are rejected are not refunded causing them to lose their tokens.

## Summary
If instant minting is not available for the amount of mTokens that the user wants to mint, the user can request a manual minting from the protocol and admins. If instant redemption's daily limit exceeds the amount of mTokens that the user wants to mint, the user can request a manual redemption from the protocol`s administrators. 
## Vulnerability Detail
When a user creates a request, in that request, tokens are transferred into protocol and admins. However, there is a missing refund logic for rejected request breaking core functionality. Requests submitted that are not approved does not refund tokens back to users. 
```solidity
    /**
     * @inheritdoc IDepositVault
     */
    function rejectRequest(uint256 requestId) external onlyVaultAdmin {
        Request memory request = mintRequests[requestId];

        require(request.sender != address(0), "DV: request not exist");
        require(
            request.status == RequestStatus.Pending,
            "DV: request not pending"
        );

        mintRequests[requestId].status = RequestStatus.Canceled;

        emit RejectRequest(requestId, request.sender);
    }

    /**
     * @inheritdoc IRedemptionVault
     */
    function rejectRequest(uint256 requestId) external onlyVaultAdmin {
        Request memory request = redeemRequests[requestId];

        _validateRequest(request.sender, request.status);

        redeemRequests[requestId].status = RequestStatus.Canceled;

        emit RejectRequest(requestId, request.sender);
    }
```
## Impact
User loses tokens when requests are rejected.
