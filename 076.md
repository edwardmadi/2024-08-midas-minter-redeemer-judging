# `mTBILL` liquidity providers receive no any incentives

## Summary
`mTBILL` liquidity providers receive no any incentives
## Vulnerability Detail
[`MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper#redeemInstant‎()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/mBasis/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol#L88-L180) allows eligible user to redeem `mBASIS` for `USDC`. 
Once the `USDC` balance in `MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper` is not enough, `mBASIS` will be swapped to `mTBILL` through `liquidityProvider`, then `mTBILL` will be redeemed for `USDC` through `mTbillRedemptionVault#redeemInstant()`.
Since `mTBILL` needs to be deposited in `liquidityProvider` as liquidity, it is reasonable that the `liquidityProvider` should receive incentive when their liquidity are used. Midas also stated this point in [their specification](https://ludicrous-rate-748.notion.site/Special-Contract-Version-User-can-instantly-redeem-mBASIS-for-USDC-via-a-mBASIS-mTBILL-swap-and-an-57e8d19b1c2242e8af50db5c8592532b):
>Separately from the smartcontract, the liquidity provider will receive most of the fees instant redemption feature applied on mBASIS

However, `redeemInstant‎()` send all fees to `feeReceiver`:
```solidity
131:        if (feeAmount > 0)
132:            _tokenTransferFromUser(address(mToken), feeReceiver, feeAmount, 18);
```
## Impact
No one is willing to provide `mTBILL` liquidity since they receive no any incentives.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A portion or all of the `feeAmount` should be transferred to `liquidityProvider` as an incentive when `mBASIS` tokens are swapped for `mTBILL` through `liquidityProvider`.
