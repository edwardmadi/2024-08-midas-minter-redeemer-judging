# Contradiction between the Specification and the Code in the `RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL` contract.

## Summary

The `threshold` parameter and the associated functionality mentioned as an `edge case` in the specification (found here: https://ludicrous-rate-748.notion.site/Special-Contract-Version-User-can-instantly-redeem-mTBILL-for-USDC-pulled-from-BUIDL-927832e82a874221996c1edcc1d94b17) are missing.

The `BUILD` token is not redeemed in full if the `BUILD` balance is less than the specified threshold.

## Vulnerability Details

There is a missing functionality described in the specification: https://ludicrous-rate-748.notion.site/Special-Contract-Version-User-can-instantly-redeem-mTBILL-for-USDC-pulled-from-BUIDL-927832e82a874221996c1edcc1d94b17

### Edge case

- Redeem the full BUIDL balance in the smart contract if the BUIDL balance will be less than 250k post-transaction (as 250k is the minimum).
Make this **250k threshold a parameter** that can be adjusted by the admin.
```

## Impact

Contradiction with the specification.

As stated by the protocol in the README: `Please note that discrepancies between the spec and the code can be reported as issues`.
