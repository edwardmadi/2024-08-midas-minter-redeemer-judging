# Variation from The link pointing to invariants and the actual implementation

## Summary
The specification document referenced in the project README outlines a specific edge case scenario and requests certain implementations. However, these requirements are not reflected in the current codebase, potentially compromising one of the system's key invariants.
## Vulnerability Detail
The project README directs attention to a specification document, stating:

_Chapter_ (Special Contract Version) User can instantly redeem mTBILL for USDC pulled from BUIDL: 

**Edge case**

- Redeem the full BUIDL balance in the smartcontract if the BUIDL balance will be less than 250k post transaction (as 250k is the minimum). Make this **250k threshold a parameter** that can be adjusted by the admin

Upon examination of the `RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL` contract, it becomes apparent that the edge case described in the specification is not implemented. Furthermore, there is no mechanism to adjust the threshold as stipulated in the requirements.
## Impact
unintended behavior and breakage of functionality when the minimum threshold is exceeded and not handled
