# RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL does not redeem full balance if BUIDL balance is less than 250k post transaction.


## Summary

RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL does not redeem full balance if BUIDL balance is less than 250k post transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the [specs](https://ludicrous-rate-748.notion.site/8060186191934380800b669406f4d83c?v=35634cda6b084e2191b83f295433efdf&p=927832e82a874221996c1edcc1d94b17&pm=s), there should be a feature that when redeeming BUIDL tokens, it should redeem full balance if the remaining BUIDL tokens is less than 250k. However, no such feature is implemented.

> Redeem the full BUIDL balance in the smartcontract if the BUIDL balance will be less than 250k post transaction (as 250k is the minimum).
Make this 250k threshold a parameter that can be adjusted by the admin

Contest readme states that "Please note that discrepancies between the spec and the code can be reported as issues", thus reporting this as a medium severity issue.

Also, note that this feature is required because BUIDL token has a minimum redemption limit of 250k (according to https://www.steakhouse.financial/projects/blackrock-buidl). Thus lack of this feature may result in lock of BUIDL tokens within the RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL contract.

> However, shares cannot be sold back unless their total value is at least $250,000, or if an exception is granted. 

```solidity
    function _checkAndRedeemBUIDL(address tokenOut, uint256 amountTokenOut)
        internal
    {
        uint256 contractBalanceTokenOut = IERC20(tokenOut).balanceOf(
            address(this)
        );
        if (contractBalanceTokenOut >= amountTokenOut) return;

        uint256 buidlToRedeem = amountTokenOut - contractBalanceTokenOut;

        buidl.safeIncreaseAllowance(address(buidlRedemption), buidlToRedeem);
        buidlRedemption.redeem(buidlToRedeem);
    }
```

## Impact

1. Lock of BUIDL token in RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL contract.
2. Discrepancy between spec and code.
