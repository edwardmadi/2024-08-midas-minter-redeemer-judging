# Incorrect `BUILD` integration in the `RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL` contract.

## Summary

In the `RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL` contract, the address of the `tokenOut` token is acquired incorrectly. It uses `ILiquiditySource.token()`, which is not present in the `BUILD` redemption contracts.

The `tokenOut` address should be taken from `IRedemption.liquidity()`.

## Vulnerability Details

Only `IRedemption` is needed in the `RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL` contract to acquire all needed addresses and to correctly redeem USDC tokens in exchange for `BUILD` tokens.

As can be seen here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x31d3f59ad4aac0eee2247c65ebe8bf6e9e470a53#readContract#F2, the `IRedemption.liquidity()` is the `USDC` address that should be used as `tokenOut` in the `RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL.redeemInstant()` function.

Current integration done in the `RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL` contract will not work with live `BUILD` contracts and will revert when calling `ILiquiditySource.token()` as there is no such view function in the `LiquiditySource` contract.

## Impact

Broken `RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL.redeemInstant()` function.

## Tools used

Manual review.

## Recommendations

Use `IRedemption.liquidity()` as the `tokenOut` address in the `RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL.redeemInstant()` function.
