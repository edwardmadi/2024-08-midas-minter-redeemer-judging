# Users can bypass sanctions check for redemption

### Summary

`mTBIIL@_beforeTokenTransfer` is only checking if the sender and recipient are blacklisted, allowing sanctioned users to bypass the sanctions check for redemption by transferring `mTBILL`/`mBASIS` tokens to a non sanctioned address.

### Root Cause

[mTBILL.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/mTBILL/mTBILL.sol#L82-L93)

```solidity
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal virtual override(ERC20PausableUpgradeable) {
        if (to != address(0)) {
            _onlyNotBlacklisted(from);
            _onlyNotBlacklisted(to);
        }

        ERC20PausableUpgradeable._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
    }
```

`mTBIIL@_beforeTokenTransfer` is not checking for sanctions.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

User is not sanctioned initially.

### Attack Path

1. The user deposits to Midas by calling `depositInstant` and gets `mTBILL`/`mBASIS` tokens back.
2. The user is sanctioned.
3. The user can still redeem using `mTBILL`/`mBASIS` tokens by transferring them to a non sanctioned address.

### Impact

User bypasses the sanctions check for redemption.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Add sanctions check on the `mTBILL` transfers as well.
