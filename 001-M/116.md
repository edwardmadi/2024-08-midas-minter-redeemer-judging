# The lack of check conditions leads to the loss of contract functions.

### Summary

It is stated in[ the document ](https://ludicrous-rate-748.notion.site/Special-Contract-Version-User-can-instantly-redeem-mTBILL-for-USDC-pulled-from-BUIDL-927832e82a874221996c1edcc1d94b17)that if the BUIDL after the transaction is less than 250k, all will be redeemed. But there is no such condition in the contract, which is a lack of functionality.
> Redeem the full BUIDL balance in the smartcontract if the BUIDL balance will be less than 250k post transaction (as 250k is the minimum).
Make this 250k threshold a parameter that can be adjusted by the admin

### Root Cause

The [contract lacks the judgment conditions for remaining BUIDL.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/52b77ba39be51f18a5b0736dfbe7f2acbbeba6e3/midas-contracts/contracts/RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL.sol#L167-L175)

### Internal pre-conditions

When the BUIDL balance is less than 250k after the transaction.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If the contract function is missing, there will be remaining BUIDL in the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the judgment condition of 250k and the function for the administrator to set the corresponding parameters.
