# Variation from The link pointing to invariants and the actual implementation

## Summary
A critical discrepancy has been identified between the specified requirements and the actual implementation in the RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL contract. The edge case handling and threshold adjustment mechanism outlined in the project documentation are absent from the codebase.
## Vulnerability Detail
"Redeem the full BUIDL balance in the smart contract if the BUIDL balance will be less than 250k post transaction (as 250k is the minimum). Make this 250k threshold a parameter that can be adjusted by the admin."

However, an examination of the RedemptionVaultWithBUIDL contract reveals:

1. No implementation of the full balance redemption when the post-transaction BUIDL balance falls below the specified threshold.
2. Absence of an adjustable threshold parameter that can be modified by the admin.
## Impact
This omission leads to a significant deviation from the intended system behavior, potentially compromising the integrity of the redemption process and the management of BUIDL balances. It represents a breach of the system's stated invariants and could lead to unexpected outcomes in edge case scenarios due to the missing logic
