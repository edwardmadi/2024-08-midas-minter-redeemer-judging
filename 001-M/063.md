# Edge case mentioned in the notion link no implemented

## Summary
the notion link provided in the readMe Talked about an edge case and asked for some stuff to be implemented, although they are not implemented, breaking one of the invariants
## Vulnerability Detail
> [Product Requirements (Specifications). Please note that discrepancies between the spec and the code can be reported as issues](https://ludicrous-rate-748.notion.site/8060186191934380800b669406f4d83c?v=35634cda6b084e2191b83f295433efdf)



quoting the above from the readMe

Now looking at `RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL` there is no where in `redeemInstant` or `_checkAndRedeemBUIDL` the redemption of full balance when the edge case happen and no variable to be changed as the threshold
## Impact
invariant breakage, unhandled Edge case, leading to bugs when we pass the minimum and don't redeem full amount
