# The protocol uses the BTC/USD pricefeed for WBTC, which is problematic if WBTC depegs from BTC

## Summary
WBTC uses the BTC/USD chainlink pricefeed which will be problematic if WBTC depegs from BTC
## Vulnerability Detail
As we know, on Ethereum Mainnet there is no [WBTC/USD](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=ethereum&page=1&search=wbt) price feed, which means that the protocol uses BTC/USD price feed for the Eth Mainnet. This is bad because in case of [WBTC depegging](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/wbtc-depeg)  from BTC, the users will eventually be minted more `mToken` than deserved, ultimately receiving more value of `mToken` for less value assets. This event is rare but possible to happen again like in 2022, especially in wild market swing or in unstable market conditions.
## Impact
Users will deposit WBTC at unreal rate, and receive more `mToken` than deserved

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check which of the networks you are going to deploy to doesn't have WBTC/USD price feed and collect the WBTC price using the WBTC/BTC feed and BTC/USD feed, as source of truth.
