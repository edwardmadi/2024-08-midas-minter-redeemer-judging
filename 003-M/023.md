# redeemRequest lacks slippage protection

## Summary
The redeemRequest and depositRequest functions do not have any slippage protection.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the redeemRequest function the user does not specify any minimum amount of token out. 
When a user calls redeemRequest they will create a request to redeem their MTokens. However in the redeemRequest function the rate that will be taken will be rate that the `mTokenDataFeed.getDataInBase18()` will return when creating the request. 
Given that the users do not specify any minimum out token amount they will have completely no control over the outToken amount they will receive which will make the redeem process unreliable, vulnerable to sandwich attacks or other MEV manipulations.
The same is applicable for the depositRequest function
## Impact
The redeem and withdraw process will be unsafe for every user - High.

## Recommendation
Create some slippage protections so that users have some control over the out token amount
