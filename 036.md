# Loss of capital for LP due to lack of slippage protection

### Summary

Liquidity provider is forced to accept any price reported from the oracle in `MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol` which can lead to NAV decrease when users use this vault.

### Root Cause

In `_swapMBasisToMToken()` `mTbillRate` and `mTokenRate` are given by the oracle, these are used to calculate the amount of `mTokenAmount`.  The LP provider is forced to accept these prices where as the user's have slippage protection since they enter a `minReceiveAmount` in `redeemInstant()`. See [L211](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/52b77ba39be51f18a5b0736dfbe7f2acbbeba6e3/midas-contracts/contracts/mBasis/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol#L211-L222)

```solidity
        uint256 mTbillRate = mTbillRedemptionVault
            .mTokenDataFeed()
            .getDataInBase18();
        uint256 mTokenRate = mTokenDataFeed.getDataInBase18();
        mTokenAmount = (mBasisAmount * mTokenRate) / mTbillRate;

        _tokenTransferFromTo(
            address(mTbillRedemptionVault.mToken()),
            liquidityProvider,
            address(this),
            mTokenAmount,
            18

```

Given that oracle prices usually vary with 0.5%-2% from the actual price, the LP must be able to somehow set a max/min value on the rates they are willing to accept or risk NAV-decrease if users swap when the oracle price over values the amount of mToken they receive.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Small discrepancy between reported oracle price and actual value. 

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Liquidity provider will have their their net-asset-value decrease since users will swap when there is a discrepancy in the oracle price that is in their favor. They can even front-run oracle updates if the profit is large enough.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make it a two step process where the LP accepts user redeems based on users `minReceiveAmount`.
