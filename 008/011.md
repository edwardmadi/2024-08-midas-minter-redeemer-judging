# Front-Running Attacks at redeemInstant for MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper  contract

### Summary

Line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/mBasis/MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper.sol#L88

The redeemInstant function involves token swapping and redemptions, which could be vulnerable to front-running attacks if attackers observe pending transactions and manipulate prices or tokens accordingly.

### Root Cause

Front running attack

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Token price manipulation.

```
startFrontRunning: This function is used to initiate the front-running attack. It sets the token approval and then calls frontRun to perform the attack. The attacker needs to monitor for the victim's transaction and submit their transaction with higher gas fees to ensure it is mined first.

frontRun: This internal function performs the actual front-running by calling the redeemInstant function on the target contract. The attacker will ideally set a higher gas price to ensure that this transaction is mined before the victim's transaction.

withdraw: This function allows the attacker to withdraw any tokens received from the front-running attack.

Step 3: Deploy and Execute the Attack
Deploy the FrontRunningAttack Contract: Deploy this contract with the address of the MBasisRedemptionVaultWithSwapper contract and the token address.

Fund the Contract: Transfer tokens to the malicious contract so it can perform the front-running attack.

Monitor for Victim’s Transactions: Use a tool or script to monitor the blockchain for pending transactions that call the redeemInstant function.

Call startFrontRunning: Execute the startFrontRunning function with the same parameters as the victim’s transaction but with a higher gas fee to front-run their transaction.

Withdraw Funds: After the attack, use the withdraw function to transfer any stolen tokens to the attacker’s address.

### Mitigation

Implement techniques like transaction batching, commit-reveal schemes, or price slippage limits to mitigate front-running risks.
