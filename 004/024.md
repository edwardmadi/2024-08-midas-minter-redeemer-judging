# `rejectRequest` does not return the tokens back to the user

## Summary
The rejectRequest function will steal Mtokens from the user
## Vulnerability Detail
In `RedemptionVault.sol` and `DepositVault.sol`  when a user calls `redeemRequest` they transfer their Mtokens to the `RedeptionVault.sol`. For the deposit they transfer the in tokens to the deposit vault.  However the  `rejectRequest` function does not return it back to the owner.
## Impact
Loss of funds for users - High
