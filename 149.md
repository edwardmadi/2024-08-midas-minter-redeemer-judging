# Minimum Deposit Check Persist over the cause of a users subsequent deposits

## Summary

The `DepositVault` contract's minimum deposit check for a new deposit persist over a users subsequent deposits unless turned off by an admin which breaks the intended behavior and hinders certain functionalities.

## Vulnerability Detail

The key issue here is that the `isFreeFromMinAmount` flag for a user is not automatically set to true after their first successful deposit. This means that the minimum amount check will be performed for every deposit, not just the first one, unless the user has been explicitly exempted using the `isFreeFromMinAmount` in the function call by the `onlyVaultAdmin` as illustrated below;

```solidity
    if (!isFreeFromMinAmount[userCopy]) { //@audit this isnt toggled to true after first deposit
        _validateMinAmount(userCopy, mintAmount);
    }
```

However, according to the documentation the right implementation will be to only perform this check on a every users first deposit and not the sunsequent deposits, meaning the `isFreeFromMinAmount` boolean should be set to true after every users first deposit, Instead, it applies to all deposits for non-exempted users, which could lead to unexpected restrictions for returning users making smaller subsequent deposits.

This discrepancy between the intended behavior and the actual implementation could cause confusion for users and potentially limit the flexibility of the system for frequent, smaller deposits after the initial threshold is met.


## Impact

This vulnerability allows users to make multiple small deposits below the intended minimum amount after their initial deposit. This could lead to:

1. Increased operational costs for the protocol due to processing many small transactions.
2. Potential economic implications if the minimum deposit amount was set for specific financial reasons.

## POC

```solidity
    function _calcAndValidateDeposit(
        address user,
        address tokenIn,
        uint256 amountToken,
        bool isInstant
    )
        internal
        returns (
            uint256 tokenAmountInUsd,
            uint256 feeTokenAmount,
            uint256 amountTokenWithoutFee,
            uint256 mintAmount,
            uint256 tokenInRate,
            uint256 tokenOutRate,
            uint256 tokenDecimals
        )
    {
        require(amountToken > 0, "DV: invalid amount");

        tokenDecimals = _tokenDecimals(tokenIn);

        _requireTokenExists(tokenIn);

        (uint256 amountInUsd, uint256 tokenInUSDRate) = _convertTokenToUsd(
            tokenIn,
            amountToken
        );
        tokenAmountInUsd = amountInUsd;
        tokenInRate = tokenInUSDRate;
        address userCopy = user;

        _requireAndUpdateAllowance(tokenIn, amountToken);

        feeTokenAmount = _truncate(
            _getFeeAmount(userCopy, tokenIn, amountToken, isInstant, 0),
            tokenDecimals
        );
        amountTokenWithoutFee = amountToken - feeTokenAmount;

        uint256 feeInUsd = (feeTokenAmount * tokenInRate) / 10**18;

        (uint256 mTokenAmount, uint256 mTokenRate) = _convertUsdToMToken(
            tokenAmountInUsd - feeInUsd
        );
        mintAmount = mTokenAmount;
        tokenOutRate = mTokenRate;

        if (!isFreeFromMinAmount[userCopy]) { //@audit this isnt toggled to true after first deposit
            _validateMinAmount(userCopy, mintAmount);
        }
        require(mintAmount > 0, "DV: invalid mint amount");
    }
```


## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement an automatic exemption mechanism after the first successful deposit. This can be achieved by setting the `isFreeFromMinAmount` flag to true after the first successful deposit, ensuring that the minimum amount check is only performed for the first deposit.
