# Admin cannot update some global vars based on specification

### Summary

According to readme:
> Product Requirements (Specifications). Please note that discrepancies between the spec and the code can be reported as issues

> This is the list of parameters that the admin can set and adjust
- <ins>Investment recipient address</ins>
	This is the address that receives the funds sent by investors when requesting a subscription (either instant or standard)
    
>  For each token_in or token_out, the admin can **add** and **update**
>  - token contract address
> - USD oracle (for checking peg, or compute exchange rates)



### Root Cause

Admin cannot update `ManageableVault::tokensReceiver` and cannot update dataFeed and contract address

### Impact

updating tokensReceiver is important becuase for any reason admin might loss access to tokensReceiver wallet address

update dataFeed is important when a datafeed become depreacted


### Mitigation

add updateTokensReceiver and updateTokenDataFeed functions
